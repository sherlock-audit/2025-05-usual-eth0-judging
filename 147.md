# Missing Treasury Balance Validation - ETH0 Burned Without Collateral Return

### Summary

Missing treasury balance validation before ETH0 burning will cause a total asset loss for users as treasury operators or external protocols will drain collateral from treasury, causing redemption to fail after ETH0 has been irreversibly burned and fees collected

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L472C4-L497C6

### Root Cause

In DaoCollateral.sol the _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral() function burns user ETH0 and mints fees before validating that the treasury has sufficient collateral balance to fulfill the transfer, violating the protocol's core backing invariant and creating a guaranteed path to user fund loss.

```solidity
    function _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 eth0Amount,
        uint256 stableFee
    ) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        // we burn the remaining ETH0 token
        uint256 burnedEth0 = eth0Amount - stableFee;
        // we burn all the ETH0 token
        $.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount);


        // If the CBR is on, the fees are forfeited from the yield treasury to favor the collateralization ratio
        if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn) {
            $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee);
        }


        // get the amount of collateral token for the amount of ETH0 burned by calling the oracle
        returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(burnedEth0, collateralToken);
        if (returnedCollateral == 0) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }


        // we distribute the collateral token from the treasury to the user
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20
        IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
    }
```

```solidity
The stated invariant "We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury" is violated in this scenario:
Before Attack:

ETH0 Total Supply: 1000 ETH0
Treasury Balance: 1000 wstETH (worth 1000 ETH)
Backing Ratio: 100% 

During Treasury Drainage:

External actor drains 500 wstETH from treasury
ETH0 Total Supply: 1000 ETH0 (unchanged)
Treasury Balance: 500 wstETH (worth 500 ETH)
Backing Ratio: 50%  (violates invariant)

During Failed Redemption:

User redeems 100 ETH0
ETH0 burned: 100 ETH0 → Total Supply: 900 ETH0
Fees collected: 2.5 ETH0 → Effective fee treasury balance
Treasury transfer fails (insufficient 97.5 wstETH)
Final State: 900 ETH0 backed by 500 wstETH = 55% backing 

The invariant is violated because:

The protocol allows external treasury drainage
Redemptions burn ETH0 before validating collateral availability
Failed transfers leave ETH0 supply reduced without corresponding collateral reduction
This creates an artificial improvement in backing ratio at user expense
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Treasury needs to have collateral balance less than required redemption amount
User needs to initiate redemption of amount requiring more collateral than treasury balance
Treasury drainage needs to occur through legitimate mechanisms (admin operations, other protocol integrations, rebalancing)

### External Pre-conditions

Treasury collateral needs to be drained by external operations (other protocol usage, admin rebalancing, slashing events for staking tokens)
Oracle price needs to remain stable during the attack (to ensure calculated collateral amount exceeds treasury balance)
No other large redemptions need to be pending that would restore treasury balance

### Attack Path

```solidity
Treasury gets drained through legitimate operations

Admin calls treasury rebalancing function
Other protocols integrated with treasury withdraw collateral
Treasury is used for yield farming that experiences losses
Slashing events reduce staking token balances (if applicable)
Current state: Treasury has 500 wstETH, but ETH0 supply is 1000


User attempts large redemption

User holds 200 ETH0 and wants to redeem for wstETH
User calculates expected output: ~195 wstETH (after 2.5% fee)
User calls redeem(wstETH, 200e18, 190e18)
Treasury only has 500 wstETH but needs 195 wstETH for this user


Redemption executes with asset burning

_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral() is called
User's 200 ETH0 is burned  (ETH0 supply: 1000 → 800)
5 ETH0 fee is minted to yield treasury  (protocol collects fee)
Function calculates returnedCollateral = 195 wstETH needed


Treasury has 0 wstETH (completely drained)
User redeems 200 ETH0 expecting 195 wstETH
ETH0 burned , fees collected 
Transfer fails: safeTransferFrom(treasury, user, 195e18) reverts
User loses 200 ETH0, protocol keeps 5 ETH0 in fees


Result violates backing invariant

Final ETH0 supply: 800 ETH0
Final treasury: 0 wstETH
Backing ratio: 0% (complete violation of invariant)
User lost 200 ETH0 permanently
```

### Impact

Users suffer a complete loss of their redeemed ETH0 amount (100% loss) when treasury lacks sufficient collateral. The protocol violates its core backing invariant by allowing ETH0 supply reduction without corresponding collateral backing, artificially improving the backing ratio for remaining users at the expense of failed redemption users.
This creates a perverse incentive where:

Failed redemptions improve the protocol's apparent health
Protocol collects fees on failed transactions
Remaining ETH0 holders benefit from improved backing ratio
Victims subsidize the protocol's backing ratio improvement

### Mitigation

Add treasury balance validation before any irreversible operations:
