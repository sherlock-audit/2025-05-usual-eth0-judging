# redeemDao misses slippage protection

### Summary

The `redeemDao()` function lacks a minimum output check, allowing the DAO to redeem ETH0 for collateral at an unfavorable price. This can lead to the DAO receiving less collateral than expected if the price feed is temporarily depressed.

### Root Cause

In [redeemDao()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L564) there is no `minAmountOut` parameter or comparable slippage guard. Unlike `redeem()`, which checks `returnedCollateral < minAmountOut`, `redeemDao()` immediately burns ETH0 and transfers collateral based solely on the current oracle rate. This omission permits redemptions at transiently low rates.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `DaoRedeemer` executes the redemption at an unfavourable rate.

Note that this can also be done unknowingly for example the `DaoRedeemer` submits the transaction and until it gets processed the exchange rate changes due to some factors.

### External Pre-conditions

The price feed for the collateral token experiences a temporary dip due to normal market activity.

### Attack Path

1. The collateral token’s price feed reflects a lower rate at redemption time.

2. The DAO’s automation or keeper calls redeemDao() while the price remains depressed.

3. The contract calculates returnedCollateral based on the lower oracle rate and transfers that smaller amount to the DAO.

4. The DAO’s treasury receives less collateral than the true market value of the burned ETH0.

### Impact

The DAO’s treasury suffers a collateral shortfall, due to executing the redemption at an unfavourable exchange rate
