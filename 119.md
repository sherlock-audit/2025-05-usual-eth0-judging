# Inconsistent Oracle Pricing Units Lead to Mispriced Collateral and Unfair `ETH0` Minting

### Summary

**Severity:** `High`
**Impact:** Unfair minting, broken protocol invariants, and potential arbitrage.

The protocol currently uses a price feed for `wstETH` that returns its value in terms of `stETH` in `LidoWstEthOracle:;latestRoundData`:
```solidity
answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
```

This price is used to determine the amount of `ETH0` a user receives when depositing `wstETH` as collateral.
However, for other collateral tokens that will be onboarded in the future (e.g., RWA tokens, Eth backed tokens), a price feed giving value in terms of `ETH` (e.g., Token/ETH) will likely be used, as no Token/stETH feeds typically exist.

This introduces a **critical** inconsistency:

- `wstETH` is valued in `stETH` units.
- Other tokens are valued in `ETH` units.
- But `stETH/ETH ≠ 1`.

When the `stETH/ETH` peg deviates `(e.g., 0.99 or 1.03, this is always true, stETH always don't stay exactly same)`, users using `wstETH` as collateral are **overvalued** or **undervalued**, leading to unfair `ETH0` minting and opening up arbitrage opportunities.

### Root Cause

Already discussed in summary.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

- Users minting `ETH0` via `wstETH` can gain unfair advantage during **stETH > ETH** depeg conditions.
- Arbitrage: Mint more `ETH0` when **stETH > ETH**, redeem when **stETH < ETH**.
- Violates protocol invariant:
    - _ETH0 minting is allowed only if backed by at least the equivalent ETH value of collateral._
- Creates misalignment in accounting and treasury risk.

### PoC

PoC:-

Note :- don't forget to whiteList bob, in this function **_whitelistRWA(token, bob)** in **setupCreationRwa1**.

```solidity
function test_PoCDifferentUnitsUsageInPriceFeeds() public {
        // Setup wstETH collateral, using wsteth/steth via function
        console2.log("wsteth is added as collateral, price feed used is wsteth/steth");
        (address ethCollateralToken, Eth0 eth0) = setupCreationRwaLido();

        console2.log(
            "The price here are only used to explain the vulnerability, real prices may vary."
        );
        console2.log(
            "We can say, for one wsteth, we get 1 steth, but if we used wsteth/eth, we would only get 0.9 ether"
        );
        console2.log(
            "creating another eth backed token, as there will be mostly no price feed availaible for token/steth, so used token/eth"
        );
        //don't forget to whiteList bob, in this function _whitelistRWA(token, bob);
        (RwaMock token,) = setupCreationRwa1(18);
        console2.log(
            "Both tokens have same price, but because of having used different price feeds, one using wsteth as collateral will recieve more than he would get than one using another token"
        );

        console2.log("===Vulnerability Starts From Here===");
        // give tokens to users
        deal(ethCollateralToken, alice, 1e18);
        deal(address(token), bob, 1e18);

        // Alice swaps 1 wstETH for ETH0
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        IERC20(ethCollateralToken).approve(address(daoCollateral), 5e18);
        daoCollateral.swap(ethCollateralToken, 1e18, 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 alicesOriginalBalance = eth0.balanceOf(alice);
        (, int256 alicesExpectedBalance,,,) = stethPrice.latestRoundData(); // this is real world price, right now steth is 0.989...ETH

        // bob swaps 1 token for ETH0
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        IERC20(address(token)).approve(address(daoCollateral), 5e18);
        daoCollateral.swap(address(token), 1e18, 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 bobsOriginalBalance = eth0.balanceOf(bob);

        console2.log("Bob's balance: ", bobsOriginalBalance);
        console2.log("Alice's balance: ", alicesOriginalBalance);
        console2.log("Expected Alice's balance: ", uint256(alicesExpectedBalance));
        console2.log(
            "Right now both bob and alice have same balance, alice's balance is inflated as the difference in price feed units"
        );
    }

Test Results

```Logs
  wsteth is added as collateral, price feed used is wsteth/steth
  The price here are only used to explain the vulnerability, real prices may vary.
  We can say, for one wsteth, we get 1 steth, but if we used wsteth/eth, we would only get 0.9 ether
  creating another eth backed token, as there will be mostly no price feed availaible for token/steth, so used token/eth
  Both tokens have same price, but because of having used different price feeds, one using wsteth as collateral will recieve more than he would get than one using another token
  ===Vulnerability Starts From Here===
  Bob's balance:  1000000000000000000
  Alice's balance:  1000000000000000000
  Expected Alice's balance:  900000000000000000
  Right now both bob and alice have same balance, alice's balance is inflated as the difference in price feed units
```

### Mitigation

- Normalize all token prices to `ETH` units, regardless of collateral type.
    **_OR_**
- For wstETH:
   - Use `stEthPerToken()` to get `wstETH → stETH`.
   - Then fetch `stETH/ETH` from Chainlink or Curve TWAP.
   - Final value: `wstETH → stETH → ETH`
