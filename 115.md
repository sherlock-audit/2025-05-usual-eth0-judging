# Oracle Initialization Missing Future Timestamp Validation

## Finding description and impact

The `initializeTokenOracle` function validates the oracle data by checking if `answer > 0`, `updatedAt != 0`, and `block.timestamp <= updatedAt + timeout`.
But it **does not check** whether `updatedAt > block.timestamp`.

This means a malicious or broken oracle could report a price update with a **future timestamp**, which would still pass the current validation checks.

## code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L45-L68

**Impact:**

* A future `updatedAt` value may cause incorrect assumptions about data freshness.
* This could allow incorrect oracle data to be accepted, leading to price manipulation or stale data usage.
* Future timestamps could interfere with timeout logic in downstream functions that depend on `updatedAt`.

## Mitigation

Add a check to ensure the oracle dataâ€™s `updatedAt` timestamp is not in the future:

```solidity
if (updatedAt > block.timestamp) {
    revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
}
```

This makes sure only valid and timely oracle data is accepted when initializing supported tokens.
