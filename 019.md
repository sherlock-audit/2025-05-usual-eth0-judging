# Improper oracle parameters can bypass all safety checks for mint amounts and break 1:1 invariant

### Summary

The parameters set in `ClassicalOracle` in an effort to enforce oracle staleness protection is flawed - and in some cases can undermine the entire protocol, breaking the collateralization invariant and leaving the protocol in a state where there is more ETH0 supply than Collateral (in terms of ETH).

I understand the contest page says: `We are adding collateral tokens without explicit oracle validation because we validate everything before launch and test on tenderly.` 

But this report is not about the oracle validation upon adding a token upon launch, but the wrong oracle validation after a token is added and the protocol is operating regularly.



### Root Cause

The root cause is in `ClassicalOracle` - where the `timeout` period which is used to ensure the oracle hasnt gone stale is allowed to set to `1 week` - this means that the oracle only has to return an up to date price once per week, and if it goes stale and returns the same price for the rest of the week - and regardless of any external changes that result in the change of price of collateral (even if very drastic) - the protocol will use that now outdated and wrong price for the remainder of the 7 day period.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L53-L54

The protocol uses `ClassicalOracle` and `AbstractOracle` to return accurate collateral prices and perform the necessary checks to ensure that the prices are up to date. In addition, `AbstractOracle` performs a check to ensure that the price (if a stablecoin as collateral) has not depegged. 

In this report I will show the flow of a user depositing collateral and minting ETH0 - and show along the way how all of the safety checks are bypassed and the 1:1 collateralization invariant is broken. 




### Internal Pre-conditions

1. When new tokens are added via `initializeTokenOracle` in `ClassicalOracle` - the `timeout` period is set to 1 week. 

```solidity
  function initializeTokenOracle(
        address token,
        address dataSource,
        uint64 timeout,
        bool isStablecoin
    ) external {
        if (token == address(0)) revert NullAddress();
        if (dataSource == address(0)) revert NullAddress();
        // The timeout can't be zero and must be at most one week
        if (timeout == 0 || timeout > ONE_WEEK) revert InvalidTimeout();
```

### External Pre-conditions

1. For this example, we are only to focus on a single token - but this can be the case with multiple tokens when multiple tokens are used as collateral 
2. Oracle last updates price 1 day ago - and the price is 1:1 - but the oracle goes stale after this 
3. The collateral token loses value , as a stablecoin, it depegs - from 1:1 -> to now its actual price is 0.8.
4. For the remainder of the 6 remaining days until the protocol will realize the price is stale, every read of price for that collateral token will return the price of 1. 

### Attack Path

Starting state:

100 - ETH0 
100 - collateral value in ETH
user is swapping / depositing 10 tokenA.

** User calls `swap` in `DaoCollateral` to initiate the minting process of depositing 10 tokenA to receive newly minted ETH0.

1. The flow of the function will call `_getPriceAndDecimals` which will call upon the oracle to return the accurate price of the collateral

```solidity
   function _getPriceAndDecimals(address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        // @audit does oracle actually send this back with 18 decimals? Chainlink may not ?
        wadPriceInETH = uint256($.oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
        decimals = uint8(IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals())
```

2. The `getPrice` function is called in `AbstractOracle` - which will then get the price via `_latestRoundData` in `ClassicalOracle` üëç 

```solidity
   function getPrice(address token) public view override returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 price, uint256 decimalsPrice) = _latestRoundData(token);
```

3. `_latestRoundData` will return the collateral price of `1` still (the last price it accurately returned 1 day ago) , and the check for staleness will not revert because the oracle wont read as stale until the 7 days has passed :

```solidity
   function _latestRoundData(address token) internal view override returns (uint256, uint256) {
        AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();
        IAggregator priceAggregatorProxy = IAggregator($.tokenToOracleInfo[token].dataSource);

        if (address(priceAggregatorProxy) == address(0)) revert OracleNotInitialized();

        uint256 decimals = priceAggregatorProxy.decimals();

        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
        (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedAt,) = priceAggregatorProxy.latestRoundData();
        if (answer <= 0) revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
        if (updatedAt > block.timestamp) revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
->        if (block.timestamp > $.tokenToOracleInfo[token].timeout + updatedAt) {
            revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
```
4. With the stale price of `1` returned, the `getPrice` function will now run a seperate check for stablecoins to ensure the stablecoin has not depegged (in which case it will revert)

```solidity
    function _checkDepegPrice(address token, uint256 wadPriceInETH) internal view {
        AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();

        // Skip the check if the token is not a stablecoin
        if (!$.tokenToOracleInfo[token].isStablecoin) return;

        uint256 threshold = Math.mulDiv($.maxDepegThreshold, SCALAR_ONE, BASIS_POINT_BASE);

        if (wadPriceInETH > SCALAR_ONE + threshold || wadPriceInETH < SCALAR_ONE - threshold) {
            revert StablecoinDepeg();
        }
```

** But none of the checks will result in a revert because the price is still represented as being `1` - not its actual current price of `0.8` - so even though the stablecoin has indeed depegged, the protocol will not realize it and everything will succeed.

5. With the oracle checks passing, the `DaoCollateral` contract will resume its `swap` process and calculate the amount of ETH0 to mint based on the returned price of the oracle (Since price is being used a 1, the protocol will calculate the need to mint 10 ETH0) - the `transferCollateralTOkenAndMintEth0` function will transfer the 10 TokenA of collateral to the treasury and call `mint` to mint 10 ETH0:

```solidity
      function _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 wadAmountInETH0
    ) internal {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        // Should revert if balance is insufficient
        IERC20Metadata(address(collateralToken)).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, $.treasury, amount);
        // Mint some ETH0
        $.eth0.mint(msg.sender, wadAmountInETH0);
```

6. Now, the `ETH0` contracts `mint` function is called and will run checks to ensure the newly mint amount will not leave the protocol in a state where there is more ETH0 minted than the ETH value of the total collateral:

```solidity
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
...
        address[] memory collateralTokens = $.tokenMapping.getAllEth0CollateralTokens();

        uint256 wadCollateralBackingInETH = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateralTokens.length;) {
            address collateralToken = collateralTokens[i];
->            uint256 collateralTokenPriceInETH = uint256(oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
            uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals();

            
            wadCollateralBackingInETH += Math.mulDiv(
                collateralTokenPriceInETH,
                IERC20(collateralToken).balanceOf(treasury),
                10 ** decimals
            );

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        if (totalSupply() + amount > wadCollateralBackingInETH) {
            revert AmountExceedBacking();
        }
        _mint(to, amount)
```

** Here it cycles through each of the collateral tokens, getting their value in ETH and then using that to check and ensure that the collateral value in ETH is not less than the ETH0 amount. 

** As can be seen, it retrieves the price in the same method shown earlier and the same checks for the oracles are ran again, but once again because the 7 day period hasnt passed - they will all succeed and no revert will happen. 

** In the end, the protocol will complete the mint of 10 ETH0 because its calculations show that there is not more ETH0 than the collateral value in ETH -> Even though the collateral value in ETH IS LOWER than the new total supply of ETH0 when the 10 ETH0 are minted, as only 8 should have been minted in a correct valuation. Also, None should have been minted because the `depeg` check should have reverted the transaction.

### Impact

The protocol will mint 10 ETH0 and receive 10 tokenA - the issue is that the 10 tokenA is actually worth only 8.

Therefore, the protocol is in a state where there is now more ETH0 than the collateral value in ETH.

Being that this can occur over and over until the oracle reads as stale, for many days, this can completely ruin the healthy collateralization of the protocol and the value of ETH0. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allowing an oracle a 7 day period until the staleness is realized is way too long, especially in this protocol where the reliance on the correct prices is absolutely necessary to maintain the goal of proper collateralization. 

Change the max `timeout` period to something more reasonable. The checks used in the `ClassicalOracle` and `AbstractORacle` are very good, but they mean nothing if the oracle is able to return a stale price for up to 7 days and function as if it was accurate and up to date.
