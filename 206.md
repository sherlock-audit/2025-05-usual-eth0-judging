# Oracle for wstEth will return the wstEth/stEth price, and not wstEth/Eth price, leading to arbitrage opportunities

### Summary

The protocol's token ETH0 is supposed to maintain it's peg to ETH, such that users can exchange ETH0 for a corresponding amount of collateral tokens valued at the price of ETH. Initially the protocol will use wstETH as it's collateral token, as such it should use the price of wstETH/ETH for determining collateral amounts, however it uses wstETH/stETH price instead, assuming a 1:1 price of stETH/ETH.

The price of stETH is not exactly 1:1 pegged with ETH - it fluctuates around 1 ETH - [link](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether/eth) . Malicios users can profit from the protocol by swapping collateral tokens at a favorable rate. 

### Root Cause

The price returned from the oracle is fetched in LidoWstEthOracle::latestRoundData:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L86
```js
    function latestRoundData()
        ...
    {
        // Return mock data for all fields except answer
        roundId = 1;
>       answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
        startedAt = block.timestamp;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        answeredInRound = 1;
    }
```

As we can see, the answer returned is the amount of stETH 1 wstETH token represents.

To understand how this is used in the protocol:

The returned value above is just returned by ClassicalOracle contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L80
```js
    function _latestRoundData(address token) internal view override returns (uint256, uint256) {
        AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();
        IAggregator priceAggregatorProxy = IAggregator($.tokenToOracleInfo[token].dataSource);

        if (address(priceAggregatorProxy) == address(0)) revert OracleNotInitialized();

        uint256 decimals = priceAggregatorProxy.decimals();

        // slither-disable-next-line unused-return
>       (, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedAt,) = priceAggregatorProxy.latestRoundData();
        if (answer <= 0) revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
        if (updatedAt > block.timestamp) revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
        // track the updatedAt value from  latestRoundData()
        // to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it
        // detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat timeout
        if (block.timestamp > $.tokenToOracleInfo[token].timeout + updatedAt) {
            revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
        }
        return (uint256(answer), decimals);
    }
```

This internal function is called by AbstractOracle::getPrice:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/AbstractOracle.sol#L103
```js
    function getPrice(address token) public view override returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 price, uint256 decimalsPrice) = _latestRoundData(token);
        price = price.tokenAmountToWad(uint8(decimalsPrice));
        _checkDepegPrice(token, price);
        return price;
    }
```

As we can see, the oracle contracts do not account for the price difference in stETH/ETH, but just return the price as if it is exactly 1:1.

This price will be used as if it is a wstETH/ETH price in the DaoCollateral contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L383
```js
    /// @dev call the oracle to get the price in ETH
    /// @param collateralToken the collateral token address
    /// @return wadPriceInETH the price in ETH with 18 decimals
    /// @return decimals number of decimals of the token
    function _getPriceAndDecimals(address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        wadPriceInETH = uint256($.oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
        decimals = uint8(IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals());
    }
```

This can be verified in the comment of _getPriceAndDecimals() function which calls the oracle. The function is used in the flows of swap() and redeem() to determine the wstETH/ETH price and thus collateral amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A second collateral token is added, apart from wstETH.

### External Pre-conditions

Fluctuations in price of stETH/ETH.

### Attack Path

To better illustrate how this arbitrage opportunity occurs, suppose there is another collateral token in the protocol - USDC and the price of stETH significantly depegs from ETH such that 1 stETH is valued at 0.9 ETH.

A user can then take the following steps:

1. swap 90 USDC for  90 $ worth stETH on third party DEX.
2. Wrap the stETH into wstETH.
3. Mint ETH0 with wstETH as collateral in the protocol - as such receive ETH0 at a discount.
4. Redeem ETH0 for 100 USDC, since USDC uses USDC/ETH oracle.


I do want to note that the depegging price check in the oracle will somewhat mitigate this, however the arbitrage opportunity will be present even for smaller price fluctuations.

If the price of stETH/ETH is more than 1, users can take the opposite path to profit extra wstETH from the rest of the collateral tokens.

### Impact

Arbitrage opportunity where users can steal collateral tokens by using the price discrepancy of stETH/ETH. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

After receiving the amount of stETH from IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken(), then use another oracle,  a stETH/ETH oracle, to convert the returned amount to the correct ETH amount .
