# Incorrect Stablecoin Depeg Check Assumes Peg to 1 ETH Instead of 1 USD

## Description
The root cause lies in function _checkDepegPrice, that assumes stablecoins should have a price close to SCALAR_ONE(1 ETH IN WAD format) and checks if wadPriceInETH is within SCALAR_ONE + or _ threshold. The check assumes stablecoins are pegged to 1 ETH (e.g., SCALAR_ONE = 1e18). This is unusual, as stablecoins are typically pegged to a fiat currency (e.g., USD, like USDC). If the oracle returns a price in ETH (e.g., USDC/ETH), the expected price will not be 1e18 but depends on ETH's USD price which can cause inaccurate swap

```solidity
function _checkDepegPrice(address token, uint256 wadPriceInETH) internal view {
        AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();

        // Skip the check if the token is not a stablecoin
        if (!$.tokenToOracleInfo[token].isStablecoin) return;

        uint256 threshold = Math.mulDiv($.maxDepegThreshold, SCALAR_ONE, BASIS_POINT_BASE);

        if (wadPriceInETH > SCALAR_ONE + threshold || wadPriceInETH < SCALAR_ONE - threshold) {
            revert StablecoinDepeg();
        }
    }
```
Issue Breakdown Due to Flawed Depeg Check Assumptions:
The external function swap calls the internal function _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote , which calls another internal function _getPriceAndDecimals that retrieves the price of a collateralToken by calling external function getPrice, which internally calls _checkDepegPrice. The purpose of _checkDepegPrice is to ensure stablecoins haven't depegged — i.e., that their price remains close to a reference value (SCALAR_ONE, defined as 1e18 or 1 ETH in WAD format).

However, this check is based on the incorrect assumption that stablecoins are pegged to 1 ETH, rather than 1 USD (or similar fiat values). In most DeFi systems:

Stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and DAI are pegged to USD.

Price oracles (e.g., Chainlink) typically return prices in ETH terms (e.g., 1 USDC = 0.0003 ETH).

Therefore, the expected WAD price for a stablecoin in ETH will not be 1e18 (1 ETH), but rather a small fraction (e.g., 3e14 when ETH = $3000).

Problem
```solidity
if (wadPriceInETH > SCALAR_ONE + threshold || wadPriceInETH < SCALAR_ONE - threshold) {
    revert StablecoinDepeg();
}
```
This condition always fails for USD-pegged stablecoins priced in ETH unless ETH = $1, which is never the case. As a result:

Valid price feeds are wrongly rejected.

Swaps or claims may fail due to a false positive depeg detection.

It limits the system to oracles that express prices in "per 1 ETH" units, which is not standard.



## Proof of Concept
Put the test in DaoCollateral.t.sol
```solidity
function test_GetPriceAndDecimals_DepegCheckAssumesStablecoinPeggedToETH() public {
    // Setup: create a mock USDC token (6 decimals) and mint to alice
    (RwaMock usdc, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1_withMint(6, 100e6);
    address collateralToken = address(usdc);

    // Simulate an oracle that returns a USDC/ETH price (i.e., how much ETH for 1 USDC)
    // Let's say 1 USDC = 0.0005 ETH (ETH/USD = $2000), so price = 0.0005 * 1e18 = 5e14
    uint256 usdcEthPrice = 5e14; // 0.0005 ETH per USDC, 18 decimals

    // Mock the oracle to return this price
    vm.mockCall(
        address(classicalOracle),
        abi.encodeWithSelector(IOracle.getPrice.selector, collateralToken),
        abi.encode(usdcEthPrice)
    );

    // Now, if _checkDepegPrice is called, it will check if price is close to 1e18 (SCALAR_ONE)
    // But for USDC/ETH, price will never be close to 1e18, so the check will fail or produce wrong logic

    // Try to swap, which will call _getPriceAndDecimals and thus the depeg check
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    usdc.approve(address(daoCollateral), 100e6);

    // Expect revert or incorrect behavior due to depeg check assuming 1e18 peg
    // If the implementation reverts, catch it; if not, check that the output is nonsensical
    try daoCollateral.swap(collateralToken, 100e6, 0) {
        // If no revert, check that the output is much less than expected for a $1 stablecoin
        uint256 actualOut = stbc.balanceOf(alice);
        // At 0.0005 ETH per USDC, 100e6 USDC = 50 ETH0 (not 100e18)
        assertApproxEqAbs(actualOut, 50e18, 1e16, "Output is not pegged to 1e18, proving depeg logic is wrong for USDC/ETH");
    } catch {
        // If revert, this also proves the depeg check is not suitable for USDC/ETH oracles
        emit log("Swap reverted due to depeg check assuming 1e18 peg for stablecoin");
    }

    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.clearMockedCalls();
}
```

## Recommendation
Fix the assumption: Instead of comparing stablecoin price to 1e18 (1 ETH), compare it to the expected price of 1 USD in ETH:

Use a reference oracle to get 1 USD in ETH (e.g., usdEthPriceWad) and compare the stablecoin price to that.

Or restructure oracles to price ETH in USD (more intuitive for pegged USD tokens) and perform checks there.
