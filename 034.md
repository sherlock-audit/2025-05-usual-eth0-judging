# `swap()` can be griefed in an edge case by front-running

### Summary

`swap()` can be griefed in an edge case if the `totalSupply` is close to `mintCap`.

### Root Cause

`swap()` calls `Eth0::mint()` to mint ETH0 tokens for the caller.

But if the totalSupply of ETH0 is close to mintCap, this function can be griefed by front-running.

[Relevant code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L140):
```solidity
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(ETH0_MINT);
        IOracle oracle = IOracle($.registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_ORACLE));
        address treasury = $.registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_TREASURY);

        // Check if minting would exceed the mint cap
@>        if (totalSupply() + amount > $.mintCap) {
            revert AmountExceedCap();
        }
```

See attack path for more details.

### Internal Pre-conditions

totalSupply close to mintCap.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

According to the README:
>  if eth0.mintCap would block the minting of new ETH0 we will raise the mint cap.

So the following attack scenario is possible:
- Attacker notices that `totalSupply()` is close to `mintCap`.
- Attacker is monitoring the mempool, he notices a swap transaction.
- Attacker front-runs it with another swap with higher gas fee, which reaches the `mintCap`.
- The legitimate user's tx will revert, costing him gas fees and preventing him from swapping.
- The admin will raise the `mintCap`.
- The legitimate user will try to swap again.
- But the attacker will front-run him again.
- After some time the user will give up.

### Impact

- Preventing legitimate users from using the protocol, as `swap()` is a critical function.
- Costing victims gas fees, as tx's will revert without achieving the intended action.
