# bypass of redemption fees when redeeming small amounts of ETH0 with low-decimal collateral tokens

### Summary

Missing minimum reedem threshold in _calculateFee will cause loss of protocol revenue as users can bypass redemption fees by performing small redemptions with low-decimal collateral tokens, causing fee amounts to round to zero during normalization.

### Root Cause

In [DaoCollateral.sol:461-467](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L458C9-L464C10) the fee normalization process performs two conversions for tokens with decimals < 18, causing potential rounding to zero:

```solidity
if (tokenDecimals < 18) {
    stableFee = Normalize.tokenAmountToWad(
        Normalize.wadAmountToDecimals(stableFee, tokenDecimals),
        tokenDecimals
    );
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol needs to have a collateral token with decimals < 18 (LST with 6 decimals)
2. Protocol's redeemFee needs to be set to a non-zero value (e.g., 50 basis points = 0.5%)

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User identifies a low-decimal collateral token (e.g., LST with 6 decimals)
2. User calculates minimum ETH0 amount that would cause fee to round to zero
3. User performs multiple small redemptions just below this threshold
4. Each redemption's fee gets rounded to zero during normalization

### Impact

The protocol suffers loss of the redemption fee revenue. The user gains by avoiding redemption fees entirely.

### PoC

Say a collateral token (LST_A with 6 decimals),
And is 1:1 with ETH,

A user swaps 0.2 LST_A for 0.2 ETH0

And then during reedem in order to bypass the redemption fee 
which is set as redeemfee = 50 0r 0.5%
The user redeems can redeem an amount of 0.00019ETH0 without paying a fee as the normalization will set the fee to zero

stableFee = 0.00019e18 * 50 / 10000  = 9.5e11

stableFee after normalization = (9.5e11/1e12) * 1e12 = 0 as solidity rounds down the first part of the calculation

### Mitigation

Add validation for minimum redemption amounts based on token decimals.
