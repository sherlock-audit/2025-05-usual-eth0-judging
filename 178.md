Following is the extract from the Contest's README

> Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of weird tokensyou want to integrate?

> We are integrating wstETH as a first collateral and we expect future LST to also be accruing.

Based on the above, it was understood that any accruing Liquid Staking Token (LST) is supported and in-scope for this contest.

Currently, the protocol assumes that the amount of collateral transferred from the users to the protocol is exactly the amount defined in the `amount` parameter of the ERC20's `safeTransferFrom` function. For instance, if it sets the `amount` to 100,000, the protocol expects to receive exactly 100,000 tokens. However, this assumption does not hold for many of the LST rebasing tokens, such as eETH (from EtherFi) and stETH (From Lido), and this is a well-known issue. For instance, transferring 1e18 eETH tokens from A to B may result in B receiving 0.99999e18 eETH tokens.

For these LSTs, since token transfers are handled via internal share accounting, the amount of tokens actually received is often less than the requested amount due to rounding errors that arise during share-to-token conversion. 

Thus, the protocol is receiving fewer collaterals than expected during the minting of ETH0. In the long run, continuous minting by users will cause the minor difference to accumulate and exacerbate the undercollateralized issue.

```solidity
File: DaoCollateral.sol
367:     function _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0(
368:         address collateralToken,
369:         uint256 amount,
370:         uint256 wadAmountInETH0
371:     ) internal {
372:         DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
373:         // Should revert if balance is insufficient
374:         IERC20Metadata(address(collateralToken)).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, $.treasury, amount);
375:         // Mint some ETH0
376:         $.eth0.mint(msg.sender, wadAmountInETH0);
377:     }
```

The similar issue occurs within the `_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral` function where the transfer of LST happens.

```solidity
File: DaoCollateral.sol
472:     function _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(
473:         address collateralToken,
474:         uint256 eth0Amount,
475:         uint256 stableFee
476:     ) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
..SNIP..
494:         // we distribute the collateral token from the treasury to the user
495:         // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20
496:         IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
497:     }
```

### Impact

The protocol is receiving fewer collaterals than expected during the minting of ETH0, which effectively leads to a loss. Furthermore, continuous minting by users will cause the minor difference to accumulate and exacerbate the undercollateralized issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The standard practice is to use the before-and-after balance to correctly determine the actually amount of LST received.

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = LST.balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20Metadata(LST).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, $.treasury, amount);
uint256 balanceAfter = LST.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 amountReceived = balanceBefore - balanceAfter;
```
