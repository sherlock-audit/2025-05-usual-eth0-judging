# swapWithPermit Silently Ignores permit() Failures, Allowing Swaps Without Verified Approval

## Description

The root cause lies inThe swapWithPermit function, it calls the permit() method inside a try/catch block that suppresses all errors thrown by permit(). Although the permit() function correctly checks for expired signatures and reverts when invalid, any such revert is caught and ignored by swapWithPermit. BUT the swap will proceed using a stale or previously granted allowance, which could lead to unexpected token transfers and user fund loss.

```solidity
try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(...) {} catch {}  // silently ignores failure
swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);              // executes regardless
```
This means the function does not guarantee that permit() succeeded before initiating a swap.

Impact: The swap will proceed using a stale or previously granted allowance, which could lead to unexpected token transfers and user fund loss



## Proof of Concept
Put the test in DaoCollateral.t.sol
```solidity
function test_SwapWithPermit_IgnoresPermitFailureAndUsesStaleAllowance() public {
    // Setup: create a mock ERC20 token with permit and mint to alice
    (RwaMock token, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1_withMint(6, 100e6);
    address collateralToken = address(token);

    // Prepare a permit signature with an expired deadline
    uint256 expiredDeadline = block.timestamp - 1 days;
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = _getSelfPermitData(
        address(token), alice, alicePrivKey, address(daoCollateral), 100e6, expiredDeadline
    );

    // Alice has previously approved daoCollateral for 100e6 tokens
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    token.approve(address(daoCollateral), 100e6);

    // The permit will revert due to expired deadline, but swapWithPermit will catch and ignore it,
    // then call swap(), which will succeed because allowance is already set (stale approval).
    uint256 aliceBalanceBefore = stbc.balanceOf(alice);
    daoCollateral.swapWithPermit(address(token), 100e6, 0, expiredDeadline, v, r, s);
    uint256 aliceBalanceAfter = stbc.balanceOf(alice);

    // Assert: swap succeeded even though permit failed, using the old allowance
    assertGt(aliceBalanceAfter, aliceBalanceBefore, "Swap succeeded using stale allowance after permit failure");

    
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

├─ [620] Eth0::balanceOf(alice: [0x6a8b32cb656559c0fC49cD7Db3ce48C074A7abe3]) [staticcall]
    │   └─ ← [Return] 100000000000000000000 [1e20]
    ├─ [0] VM::assertGt(100000000000000000000 [1e20], 0, "Swap succeeded using stale allowance after permit failure") [staticcall]
    │   └─ ← [Return]
    ├─ [0] VM::stopPrank()
    │   └─ ← [Return]
    └─ ← [Stop]

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 11.41s (1.38s CPU time)




## Recommendation
Replace the try/catch with:
```solidity
require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Permit: expired deadline");

IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
    msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
);
```
Or at least check allowance before swapping, if you want to keep try/catch.

          OR
Remove the try/catch and let permit() revert on failure, causing the entire transaction to revert if the permit is invalid or expired.

Alternatively, explicitly check that the permit succeeded before proceeding.

Optionally, add an explicit deadline check before calling permit() to fail early.
