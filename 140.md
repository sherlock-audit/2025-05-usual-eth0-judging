# Fee Revenue Loss During Counter Bank Run

### Summary

Conditional fee minting logic during Counter Bank Run periods will cause fee revenue loss for the protocol as admins will strategically activate CBR during high-volume periods to prevent fee collection while still charging users redemption fees.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L472C4-L497C6

### Root Cause

In DaoCollateral.sol:_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral() the fee minting is conditionally skipped during CBR periods, creating a scenario where redemption fees are calculated and deducted from user returns but never actually collected by the protocol treasury.

```solidity
    function _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 eth0Amount,
        uint256 stableFee
    ) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        // we burn the remaining ETH0 token
        uint256 burnedEth0 = eth0Amount - stableFee;
        // we burn all the ETH0 token
        $.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount);


        // If the CBR is on, the fees are forfeited from the yield treasury to favor the collateralization ratio
        if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn) {
            $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee);
        }


        // get the amount of collateral token for the amount of ETH0 burned by calling the oracle
        returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(burnedEth0, collateralToken);
        if (returnedCollateral == 0) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }


        // we distribute the collateral token from the treasury to the user
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20
        IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call activateCBR(coefficient) to set isCBROn to be exactly true
Redemption fee needs to be set to be at least greater than 0 (non-zero fee configured)
Users need to perform redemption operations while CBR is active
Treasury yield address needs to be configured to receive fee payments

### External Pre-conditions

High volume of redemption activity needs to occur during CBR periods to maximize fee revenue loss
Market conditions need to trigger legitimate or strategic CBR activation by admins

### Attack Path

Admin monitors redemption volume and identifies periods of high redemption activity with significant fee revenue potential
Admin calls activateCBR(coefficient) strategically timing activation to coincide with high-volume redemption periods
Users perform redemptions during CBR period paying calculated fees that appear to be collected normally
Fee calculation occurs normally with stableFee = _calculateFee(amount, collateralToken) computing proper fee amounts
Fee minting is skipped due to CBR condition if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn) evaluating to false
Users receive reduced collateral as burnedEth0 = eth0Amount - stableFee subtracts fees from their return amount
Protocol loses fee revenue as calculated fees disappear into the void without being minted to treasury
Admin can repeat by deactivating and reactivating CBR around high-volume periods

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of 100% of redemption fees during CBR periods while users still pay these fees through reduced collateral returns. The fee value is effectively destroyed rather than collected, creating a value leak where neither users nor protocol benefit from the calculated fees.

### PoC

```solidity
function testCBRFeeRevenueLoss() public {
    // Setup: Configure 5% redemption fee
    uint256 redeemFee = 500; // 5% in basis points
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.setRedeemFee(redeemFee);
    
    // Setup: User has 1000 ETH0 to redeem
    uint256 eth0Amount = 1000e18;
    setupUserWithETH0(user, eth0Amount);
    
    // Setup: Treasury has sufficient wstETH backing
    uint256 treasuryBalance = 1000e18;
    setupTreasuryBalance(treasuryBalance);
    
    // Record initial state
    uint256 initialTreasuryYieldBalance = eth0.balanceOf(treasuryYield);
    uint256 initialTotalSupply = eth0.totalSupply();
    
    // Activate CBR
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.activateCBR(0.9e18); // 90% coefficient
    
    // User redeems during CBR
    vm.prank(user);
    uint256 returnedCollateral = daoCollateral.redeem(address(wstETH), eth0Amount, 0);
    
    // Calculate expected fee
    uint256 expectedFee = (eth0Amount * redeemFee) / 10000; // 50 ETH0 fee
    uint256 expectedBurned = eth0Amount - expectedFee; // 950 ETH0 burned
    
    // Verify fee was calculated but not collected
    assertEq(eth0.balanceOf(treasuryYield), initialTreasuryYieldBalance); // No fee minted
    assertEq(eth0.totalSupply(), initialTotalSupply - eth0Amount); // Full amount burned
    
    // Verify user paid the fee through reduced returns
    uint256 expectedReturnWithoutFee = _calculateExpectedReturn(eth0Amount);
    uint256 expectedReturnWithFee = _calculateExpectedReturn(expectedBurned);
    assertEq(returnedCollateral, expectedReturnWithFee); // User got reduced amount
    assert(returnedCollateral < expectedReturnWithoutFee); // User effectively paid fee
    
    // Compare with non-CBR scenario
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.deactivateCBR();
    
    // Reset and test normal redemption
    setupUserWithETH0(user2, eth0Amount);
    vm.prank(user2);
    daoCollateral.redeem(address(wstETH), eth0Amount, 0);
    
    // Verify fee was properly collected
    assertEq(eth0.balanceOf(treasuryYield), expectedFee); // Fee minted to treasury
}

function testStrategicCBRFeeAvoidance() public {
    // Simulate malicious admin avoiding fees during high volume
    uint256 highVolumeRedemptions = 10000e18; // Large redemption volume
    uint256 expectedTotalFees = (highVolumeRedemptions * 500) / 10000; // 500 ETH0 in fees
    
    // Admin strategically activates CBR before high volume period
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.activateCBR(0.95e18);
    
    // Multiple users redeem during CBR (high volume period)
    for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        address redeemer = makeAddr(string(abi.encodePacked("redeemer", i)));
        setupUserWithETH0(redeemer, 1000e18);
        vm.prank(redeemer);
        daoCollateral.redeem(address(wstETH), 1000e18, 0);
    }
    
    // Verify protocol lost all fee revenue
    assertEq(eth0.balanceOf(treasuryYield), 0); // No fees collected
    
    // Admin deactivates CBR after high volume period
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.deactivateCBR();
    
    // Protocol lost 500 ETH0 worth of fee revenue
    uint256 lostFeeValue = expectedTotalFees;
    assert(lostFeeValue > 0); // Confirm revenue was lost
}
```

### Mitigation

Modify the fee collection logic to ensure fees are always collected during CBR periods
