# Blacklist bypass due to lack of msg.sender blacklisting check

### Summary

Lack of `msg.sender` blacklisting check leads to bypass blacklisting.

### Root Cause

[`Eth0::_update()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L222) checks only that `from` and `to` are not blacklisted, but doesn't check if the `msg.sender` is blacklisted, allowing blacklisted addresses to use `transferFrom()` to transfer funds freely if they have approval in another account.

Relevant code:
```solidity
        if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Blacklister notices a malicious activity from Alice's address, he blacklists her address, thinking she can no longer transfer tokens.
2. Bob approves Alice to transfer his tokens.
3. Alice continues her malicious activities using Bob's funds, by using `transferFrom()` instead of `transfer()`.

### Impact

Blacklist bypass by allowing blacklisted addresses to transfer tokens freely using `transferFrom()` on another account if they have approval.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure that `msg.sender` is not blacklisted.
