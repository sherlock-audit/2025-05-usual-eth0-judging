# Unbounded CBR Coefficient Allows Near-Total User Fund Confiscation

### Summary

The missing check in `DaoCollateral.sol` will cause near-total fund loss during redemptions for all users as malicious/compromised admin will set coefficient to 0.0001e18 and front-run large redemptions.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L247-L261` The activateCBR() function accepts any coefficient between 0-1e18 without minimum bounds that lead to user found loose.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call activateCBR() to set cbrCoef to be less than 70%
2. Admin needs to call activateCBR() to set isCBROn to go from false to true within one transaction.
3. System needs to have swapPaused automatically set to true when CBR activates.

### External Pre-conditions

1.No external monitoring system detects/admin alerts on CBR activation
2.No competing protocol offers better redemption terms during CBR activation
3.No governance proposal is required before CBR activation

### Attack Path

1.Attacker gains admin privileges (compromises keys or becomes malicious admin).
2.Attacker monitors mempool for large redemption transactions.
3.Attacker calls activateCBR(0.0001e18).
4.Transaction is front-run before target redemption executes.


### Impact

The redeeming users suffer an approximate loss of 99.99% of collateral value during redemptions. The attacker/admin gains this 99.99% difference from users' expected redemption value.


### PoC

1.Normal redemption: User receives 1000 ETH collateral for 1000 ETH0.
2.Under attack: User receives 0.1 ETH (0.01%) for 1000 ETH0.
3.Attacker profit: 999.9 ETH per 1000 ETH0 redeemed

The loss scales linearly with protocol Total Value Locked and continues until CBR is deactivated, or no redeemable ETH0 remains in circulation.

### Mitigation

```diff
function activateCBR(uint256 coefficient) external {
if (coefficient > SCALAR_ONE) {
            revert CBRIsTooHigh();
-   if (coefficient == 0) revert CBRIsNull();
+   if (coefficient < 0.7e18 || coefficient == 0) revert CBRBelowMinimum(); // 70% floor
        _requireOnlyAdmin();
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        $.isCBROn = true;
        $._swapPaused = true;
        $.cbrCoef = coefficient;
        emit CBRActivated($.cbrCoef);
        emit SwapPaused();
}
```
