# `swapWithPermit` will Revert for Users if the collateral token is DAI

### Summary

The use of non-standard EIP-2612 permit signatures in DAI will cause transaction failures for users, as the swapWithPermit function will revert when DAI is used as collateral.

### Root Cause

The protocol will support several tokens as collateral, which may include stablecoins like DAI. However, DAI implements a different permit signature format than the standard EIP-2612 used by other tokens. The `swapWithPermit` function assumes all collateral tokens use the standard permit signature structure (owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, s), but DAI uses a non-standard format (holder, spender, nonce, expiry, allowed, v, r, s).
From the contract at address `0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F`, we see DAI permit function:

`function permit(address holder, address spender, uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry, bool allowed, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external`
The `nonce` and `allowed` arguments are added to DAIâ€™s permit which differs to the signature of [`swapWithPermit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L521-L535)


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol admins must add DAI as a collateral token

### External Pre-conditions

Users must attempt to use swapWithPermit with DAI as collateral token

### Attack Path

1. Admin adds DAI as collateral token
2. User initiates swapWithPermit transaction with DAI collateral
3. Protocol calls DAI.permit() with standard EIP-2612 parameters
4. DAI contract rejects the call due to signature format mismatch
5. Entire transaction reverts

### Impact

Users cannot execute swaps with `swapWithPermit` when using DAI as collateral.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

For the case of DAI token, allow a different implementation of the permit function, which allows nonce and allowed variables.
