# Depeg checks use the same threshold for all stablecoins

### Summary

The protocol sets the same depegging threshold for different stablecoins (pegged ETH), which does not apply to different tokens.

### Root Cause

When getting the price of stablecoins (pegged to ETH), the protocol checks if the stablecoin is [depegged](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/AbstractOracle.sol#L134-L145).
```solidity
    function _checkDepegPrice(address token, uint256 wadPriceInETH) internal view {
        AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();

        // Skip the check if the token is not a stablecoin
        if (!$.tokenToOracleInfo[token].isStablecoin) return;

        uint256 threshold = Math.mulDiv($.maxDepegThreshold, SCALAR_ONE, BASIS_POINT_BASE);

        if (wadPriceInETH > SCALAR_ONE + threshold || wadPriceInETH < SCALAR_ONE - threshold) {
            revert StablecoinDepeg();
        }
    }
```
The problem here is that the protocol uses the same depegging threshold for different tokens.

For example, for fraxETH, according to the [official documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth#frxeth), a threshold of 1% is appropriate.

However, for OETH, since they have achieved [instant redemption](https://docs.originprotocol.com/protocol/oeth) of OETH to ETH, the threshold should be much smaller than fraxETH.

So in order for the protocol to work properly, the protocol has to use a looser threshold, which results in not being able to perform depegging checks for tokens that are more tightly pegged.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to set different depegging thresholds for different tokens
