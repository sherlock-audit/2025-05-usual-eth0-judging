# Users who deposit after CBR is turned on risk losing their funds

### Summary

the CBR mechanism is used to ensure that the `ETH0` in circulation still has enough backing even after price variations (much like a mechanism to retain the peg of `ETH0` to the collateral

### Root Cause

The protocol allows swapping after cbr is turned on without putting into consideration the `cbrCoef` thus forcing the user to loose funds even when they redeem their funds

```sol
File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
508:     function swap(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)
509:         public
510:         nonReentrant
511:         whenSwapNotPaused
512:         whenNotPaused
513:     {
514:   @>    uint256 wadQuoteInETH = _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote(collateralToken, amount);

File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
341:     function _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote(address collateralToken, uint256 amountInToken)

////SNIP
359:         wadQuoteInETH = _getQuoteInETH(amountInToken, collateralToken); // round down

File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
402:     function _getQuoteInETH(uint256 tokenAmount, address collateralToken)
403:         internal
404:         view
405:         returns (uint256 wadAmountInETH) // USD value of this tokenAmount
406:     {
407:         (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals) = _getPriceAndDecimals(collateralToken);
408:         uint256 wadAmount = tokenAmount.tokenAmountToWad(decimals);
409:         wadAmountInETH = Math.mulDiv(wadAmount, wadPriceInETH, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
410:     }

```

A seen above, irrespective of whether or not the cbr is on, the swap goes through normally with the user receiving the desired amount of `ETH0` (with price factored in). However looking at the [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L442) function below, the users received amount still gets scaled down by the `cbrCoef`. Thus forcing losses on the users even if they swapped in after the CBR took effect to protect the protocol in its current state

```sol
File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
542:     function redeem(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)

////SNIP
558:         uint256 returnedCollateral =
559:   @>        _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, stableFee);


File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
476:     function _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(

////SNIP
492:         // get the amount of collateral token for the amount of ETH0 burned by calling the oracle
493:    @>   returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(burnedEth0, collateralToken);


File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
432:     function _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(uint256 wadStableAmount, address collateralToken)

////SNIP
440:         // cbrCoef should be less than 1e18
441:   @>    if ($.isCBROn) {
442:     @>      amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
443:         }
444:     }

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

NIL

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- price fluctuates and crb is turned on with `cbrCoef` adjusted down accordingly, ensuring the current users do not withdraw more than required to properly backup the system
- Bob swaps in and gets desired amount of `ETH0` (considering the current price)
- Bob decides to redeem out but receives less collateral because `cbrCoef` was factored into his redemption

### Impact

Loss of funds for users who swap in after cbr is turned on

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider caching the `cbrCoef` of each user at the point they make a swap in and ONLY effect the bank run shortfall if the `cbrCoef` has fallen below the one cached for the user at the point of swap in, else use the ine they used at the point they made the swap in.
