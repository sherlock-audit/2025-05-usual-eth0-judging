# `Eth0.pause()` Halts Mint & Burn, Causing Protocol-Wide DoS

### Summary

The README states that pausing the Eth0 token “blocks all token transfer operations.”

In reality the contract inherits `ERC20PausableUpgradeable`; its `whenNotPaused` modifier also guards the internal `_mint` and `_burn` hooks.
Because every swap or redeem in DaoCollateral calls `eth0.mint` or `eth0.burnFrom,` pausing Eth0 instantly reverts all deposits and redemptions—even when `DaoCollateral` itself is not paused—producing an unintended, system-wide denial of service.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
    internal
    virtual
    override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable)
{
    super._update(from, to, amount);     // ERC20Pausable checks `paused()`
}

```
OpenZeppelin’s ERC20PausableUpgradeable applies whenNotPaused to _update, which is invoked for mint, burn, and transfer.
Thus pause() blocks all three, contradicting the README’s narrower intent.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Pauser pauses `Eth0` to stop transfers.

Any swap tries `eth0.mint(…)` → `_update ⇒ reverts` with “paused.”

Any redeem tries `eth0.burnFrom(…)` → same revert.

All collateral inflows/outflows are impossible despite `DaoCollateral` being unpaused.

### Impact

protocol wide DOS

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use custom pause that allows `mint` and `burn` to align with intended README statement
