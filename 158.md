# Redemption Fee Manipulation

### Summary

The setRedeemFee function in the DaoCollateral contract allows an admin with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to unilaterally update the redemption fee, subject only to basic checks (fee must be non-zero and not exceed MAX_REDEEM_FEE, set at 2500 basis points or 25%). This centralization of control poses a significant risk: a malicious or compromised admin could manipulate the fee to extract excessive value from users redeeming Eth0 tokens or disrupt the protocol's operations. The lack of governance mechanisms, such as timelocks or multi-signature approvals, amplifies this vulnerability, potentially leading to financial losses for users and erosion of trust in the protocol.

### Root Cause

The choice to allow the admin to unilaterally set the redemption fee without additional governance checks or timelocks is a mistake, as it enables a malicious or compromised admin to manipulate the fee to extract excessive value from users or disrupt the protocol.

The root cause is a design flaw in the setRedeemFee function.

The function relies solely on the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for access control via the _requireOnlyAdmin modifier, with no additional safeguards to prevent or delay fee changes. This single point of failure allows an admin to instantly set the fee to any value between 1 and 2500 basis points, creating a centralization risk if the admin role is compromised or acts maliciously.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin Role: The attacker must hold the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (enforced by registryAccess).
Contract Not Paused: The global pause state must be false (paused() == false).
Redemption Not Paused: The redemption-specific pause state must be false (_redeemPaused == false).
Current Fee Adjustable: The current redeemFee must be less than the desired malicious value (e.g., redeemFee < MAX_REDEEM_FEE).


### External Pre-conditions

ETH oracle price manipulation: The redemption process relies on an oracle (IOracle) to determine the collateral amount via _getPriceAndDecimals. If the ETH oracle price shifts dramatically, it could inflate the collateral value returned, amplifying the impact of a high redemption fee set by a malicious admin.

Gas price stability: A specific gas price might allow an attacker to optimize transaction costs while manipulating the fee and redeeming tokens, though this is less directly tied to the setRedeemFee function itself.

### Attack Path

The attacker gains control of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE through social engineering, private key compromise, or exploiting a flaw in the registryAccess role assignment.

The attacker calls setRedeemFee to set the redemption fee to 2500 basis points (the maximum allowed value), passing all checks since 2500 <= MAX_REDEEM_FEE.

Users redeem Eth0 tokens via the redeem function, unaware of the fee increase.

The contract calculates a 25% fee on the redeemed amount, minting it to the treasuryYield, reducing the collateral returned to users.

The attacker extracts the fee revenue from the treasury, profiting from the manipulated fee if they control the treasuryYield address.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of up to 25% of their redeemed value during the redemption process. The attacker (malicious admin) gains the excessive fee revenue redirected to the treasury.When the redemption fee is manipulated to its maximum value of 2500 basis points (25%), users redeeming Eth0 tokens lose a significant portion of their collateral. For example:

Redeeming 100 Eth0 tokens incurs a fee of 25 Eth0, calculated as Math.mulDiv(eth0Amount, $.redeemFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Floor) in the _calculateFee function.The user receives only 75% of the expected collateral after the fee is minted to the treasuryYield.The attacker, potentially controlling or benefiting from the treasuryYield, profits from the excessive fees at the users' expense.Additionally, the protocol may suffer reputational damage and reduced usage due to perceived unfairness or exploitation, further compounding the financial impact.

### Mitigation

Implement a timelock mechanism: Require a delay before fee changes take effect, allowing users to react and reducing the impact of sudden manipulations.
