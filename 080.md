# deactivateCBR Fails To Re-Enable Swap Functionality

### Summary

The `deactivateCBR` function fails to unpause the swap functionality, causing swap operations to remain paused for all users after Counter Bank Run (CBR) mode is deactivated, as it fails to reset the _swapPaused flag.

### Root Cause

In `DaoCollateral.sol:deactivateCBR()` function, the `_swapPaused` state variable is not reset to false after CBR is deactivated, despite the `activateCBR` function setting `_swapPaused` to true. This omission prevents users from performing swap operations after CBR mode is turned off.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Admin needs to call `activateCBR(uint256 coefficient)` to set `isCBROn = true` and `_swapPaused` to true.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `activateCBR(uint256 coefficient)` to enable CBR mode, which sets `isCBROn` to true and `_swapPaused` to true.
2. Admin calls `deactivateCBR()` to disable CBR mode, which sets `isCBROn` to false but does not modify `_swapPaused`.
3. Users attempt to call `swap(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)` or `swapWithPermit(...)` but are reverted due to the `whenSwapNotPaused` modifier checking `_swapPaused` (still true), triggering the `SwapMustNotBePaused` error.


### Impact

Users cannot perform swap operations, preventing them from exchanging collateral tokens for ETH0 tokens until an `PAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE` manually calls `unpauseSwap()`.

### PoC

As explained in attack path

### Mitigation

Modify the `deactivateCBR` function to `unpause` the swap functionality by setting `_swapPaused` to false.
