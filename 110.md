# Flawed redemption mechanism that allowed selective asset withdrawal, leading to collateral pool imbalance

### Summary

According to document:
>We are integrating wstETH as a first collateral and we expect future LST to also be accruing

The protocol will support up to 10 types of collateral, and users can freely choose any collateral from the list.
While this design appears fair on the surface, it fails to enforce proportional redemption or maintain proper collateral balance, making it vulnerable to liquidity drain and destabilization, especially in adverse market conditions.

This is similar to what happened in Lybra v1, where users drained all stETH from the treasury, leaving behind a partially backed system with poor recoverability.

### Root Cause

In the `DaoCollateral.sol::redeem()`

```solidity
    function redeem(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenRedeemNotPaused
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Amount can't be 0
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        // check that collateralToken is a collateral token
        if (!_daoCollateralStorageV0().tokenMapping.isEth0Collateral(collateralToken)) {
            revert InvalidToken();
        }
        uint256 stableFee = _calculateFee(amount, collateralToken);
        uint256 returnedCollateral =
            _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, stableFee);
        // Check if the amount is greater than the minAmountOut
        if (returnedCollateral < minAmountOut) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }
        emit Redeem(msg.sender, collateralToken, amount, returnedCollateral, stableFee);
    }
```

Redeemer can freely choose any collateral from the list.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- Initially, the treasury is fully collateralized with wstETH.
- Over time, the protocol introduces multiple collateral types (e.g., rETH, ETH, sfrxETH).
- Users selectively redeem only the most liquid or valuable collateral (e.g., wstETH) while leaving the less desirable ones behind.
- This leads to collateral pool imbalance, resulting in a situation where:
- ETH0 remains in circulation.
- Treasury holds low-quality or illiquid collateral.
- Redeem pressure spikes and confidence collapses.

### Impact

Redeem pressure spikes and confidence collapses

### Mitigation

Users should receive a basket of collateral tokens in proportion to the pool composition, not just the most valuable asset.
