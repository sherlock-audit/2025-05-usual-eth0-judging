# Missing Deadline Protection in Swap and Redeem Operations

### Summary

The [swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L504), redeem, and redeemDao functions in DaoCollateral.sol lack deadline parameters, allowing transactions to be executed after extended delays when market conditions may have changed significantly, potentially causing user losses.

### Root Cause

The protocol functions do not implement deadline validation (block.timestamp <= deadline check) before executing time-sensitive operations like swaps and redemptions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- User needs to call swap, redeem, or redeemDao functions to initiate a transaction without deadline protection
- Transaction needs to remain in the mempool for an extended period due to low gas fees or network congestion
- Protocol state needs to allow the delayed transaction to still be valid when finally executed

### External Pre-conditions

- Network congestion needs to occur causing transaction delays in the mempool
- Market prices need to move significantly between transaction submission and execution
- Oracle prices need to update during the delay period, potentially changing swap rates or redemption values

### Attack Path

1. User submits a swap or redeem transaction during favorable market conditions with low gas fees
2. Network becomes congested, causing the transaction to remain pending in the mempool
3. Market conditions change significantly (e.g., token prices drop, oracle updates reflect new rates)
4. Protocol parameters or collateral ratios are updated during the delay
5. The stale transaction eventually gets mined and executed under the new, unfavorable conditions
6. User receives significantly less value than expected when they originally submitted the transaction, resulting in unintended losses

### Impact

Users may experience unexpected losses due to stale transactions being executed after significant market movements or protocol parameter changes. This is particularly problematic for swap operations where price movements could be substantial.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add deadline parameters to swap and redeem functions and validate that block.timestamp <= deadline before executing operations. This is a standard protection mechanism in DeFi protocols.
