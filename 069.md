# Admin Can Set Arbitrary Redemption Fees via setRedeemFee(), Enabling Value Extraction.

### Summary

The setRedeemFee() function in `DaoCollateral.sol` allows privileged admins  to arbitrarily set redemption fees up to 25% (MAX_REDEEM_FEE) without time delays or governance oversight. This creates a centralization risk where
a malicious/compromised admin can maximize fees to 25% for profit.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L273-L281` Uses single-admin control (_requireOnlyAdmin()), creating centralized value extraction risk if the admin is malicious.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.Admin needs to call setRedeemFee() to set redeemFee to be at most MAX_REDEEM_FEE (25%).
2.Admin needs to call setRedeemFee() to set redeemFee to go from current value to new value within one transaction.


### External Pre-conditions

1.No competing protocol must offer better redemption rates during fee spikes
2.ETH0 token price must remain stable despite fee increases (no immediate arbitrage).

### Attack Path

1.Admin calls setRedeemFee(2500), Sets fee to 25% (MAX_REDEEM_FEE) in one transaction.
2.User initiates redeem(1000 ETH0). Expects 1000 ETH return (0% fee scenario), Protocol applies 25% fee automatically.
3.System processes: Burns 1000 ETH0 from user: Transfers 750 ETH to user (25% fee retained).

### Impact

Direct Financial Loss: Each redemption loses 25% value (worst-case).

### PoC

Normal Operation (0.1% fee): User redeems 1000 ETH0 → receives 999 ETH.
Attack Scenario (25% fee): User redeems 1000 ETH0 → receives only 750 ETH.

### Mitigation

1.Multi-Sig Requirement: Replace _requireOnlyAdmin() with multi-sig approval (e.g., 2/3 signers).
2.Force a delay between fee changes to allow user reaction.
