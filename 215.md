# Surge in ETH Price will render Minting Function Unusable leading to protocol DOS

### Summary

The ETH-denominated collateral check in the mint function will cause protocol functionality loss for legitimate users during ETH price surges as the ETH value of dollar-pegged collateral decreases, leading to minting failures until ETH price correction.

### Root Cause

In `[mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L129-L166)` function, the collateral adequacy check uses ETH-denominated valuation (`wadCollateralBackingInETH`) which can dos minting functionality as ETH price surges reduce the ETH value of collateral while ETH0 supply remains fixed, creating artificial collateral insufficiency that blocks legitimate minting operations.
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        .....
        address[] memory collateralTokens = $.tokenMapping.getAllEth0CollateralTokens();

        uint256 wadCollateralBackingInETH = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateralTokens.length;) {
            address collateralToken = collateralTokens[i];
            uint256 collateralTokenPriceInETH = uint256(oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
            uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals();

            wadCollateralBackingInETH += Math.mulDiv(
                collateralTokenPriceInETH,
                IERC20(collateralToken).balanceOf(treasury),
                10 ** decimals
            );

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        if (totalSupply() + amount > wadCollateralBackingInETH) {
            revert AmountExceedBacking();
        }
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
```
Here, we can see that all the collateral assets are converted to the equivalent eth value and summed up, which is then compared to the total supply of ETH0.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Protocol must hold collateral tokens including stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI)
ETH price must increase significantly (>20%)

### External Pre-conditions

ETH price increases rapidly 
Users attempt to mint ETH0 during the price increase

### Attack Path

1. Market surge causes ETH price to increase 30% (e.g., $2000 → $2600)
2. Treasury collateral:
Pre-surge: $100M stablecoins = 50,000 ETH ($2000/ETH)
Post-surge: $100M stablecoins = 38,461.54 ETH ($2600/ETH)
ETH0 supply remains constant at 50,000 ETH0
3. User attempts to mint new ETH0:
```solidity
totalSupply() + amount (50,000 + X) > wadCollateralBackingInETH (38,461.54 + collateral for x amount of ETH0)
// Always true → revert AmountExceedBacking()
```
Minting remains blocked until ETH price decreases

### Impact

Users cannot mint ETH0 during ETH price surges
Protocol utility disabled for extended periods (days/weeks)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Convert collateral checks to USD denomination:
Convert both the total supply of ETH0 and the collaterals in various tokens to USD, then make the comparison.
