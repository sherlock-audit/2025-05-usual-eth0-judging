# Conflicting Logic in `redeemDao` During CBR(Counter-Bank-Run) Mode

### Summary

When the Counter-Bank-Run flag (`isCBROn`) is active, `redeemDao` waives the redemption fee yet still applies the CBR coefficient (`cbrCoef`) to shrink the collateral payout. As a result, the DAO both gets fee-exempt treatment and simultaneously suffers a discounted payout—two actions that counteract each other as the former decreases ETH0’s backing and the latter increases it

Ideally, when `isCBROn` is true:

 - Burn Fees First: The contract should burn the normal redemption fee (thereby increasing ETH0’s value for remaining holders).

- Apply CBR Coefficient: The contract  then scale down the collateral returned by cbrCoef, reflecting reduced liquidity.

Currently, redeemDao skips the fee but applies cbrCoef, so it neither burns fees (to uphold ETH0’s backing) nor consistently exempt DAO when applying  CBR coefficient during redeeming leading causing contradictory behaviour. 



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L437

`redeemDao` always calls
```solidity
_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, 0);

```
exempting fees by passing `fee = 0`. 

Inside `_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral`, `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH`  does:
```solidity
if ($.isCBROn) {
    amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
}

```
This is fine under normal protocol functioning but however when `isCBROn` is true the DAO avoids the fee and endures a CBR cut—two actions that negate one another

When CBR mode is active, the protocol should choose one of two consistent approaches: either 
(a) Burn protocol redemption fee and apply the CBR coefficient to DAO withdrawals just like any user— by doing;

```solidity
// in the function redeemDao
uint256 feeToApply = isCBROn ? redeemFee : 0

 uint256 returnedCollateral = _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, 0);

``` 

b) exempt the DAO entirely from both fees and the CBR cut— by doing

```solidity

// in the function _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH

if (isCBROn && msg.sender != dao) {
    amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);


}

```


### Internal Pre-conditions

- `isCBROn == true` in storage.

- Caller holds the `DAO_REDEMPTION_ROLE`.

- `redeemDao(collateralToken, amount)` is invoked.

### External Pre-conditions

CBR has been activated by an admin (via  `activateCBR(coefficient`)

### Attack Path

No external attacker is required. Sequence:

- Admin enables CBR → `isCBROn = true`.

- DAO redeemer calls `redeemDao(...)`.

- Fee is waived (`fee = 0)`, but `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` still applies `cbrCoef`.



### Impact

Waiving the redemption fee weakens ETH0’s backing, while simultaneously applying cbrCoef reduces the DAO’s collateral,  these opposing effects should be replaced with a consistent as outlined above.
