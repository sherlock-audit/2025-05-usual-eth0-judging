# Explanation of Missing Slippage Protection

### Summary


The  issue is that the redeemDao function lacked slippage protection, exposing the DAO to potential value loss during redemptions:



function redeemDao(address collateralToken, uint256 amount)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
{
    // ... no minAmountOut parameter ...
    uint256 returnedCollateral = _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, 0);
    // ... no check against minimum expected ...
}




The Risk: Unprotected Value Extraction

Oracle Manipulation Risk:

Attackers could front-run DAO redemptions to manipulate oracle prices

DAO receives fewer collateral tokens than fair value




Market Volatility Exposure:

Prices could drop between transaction signing and execution

DAO receives less value than expected




Systemic Vulnerability:

DAO treasury could be drained at unfavorable rates

Protocol reserves depleted through repeated small attacks








Attack Scenario
Setup:

ETH0 price: $1000

USDC price: $1.00

Fair redemption: 1000 ETH0 â†’ $1,000,000 USDC


Attack:

Attacker sees DAO redemption TX in mempool

Front-runs with large USDC sell order

Temporarily drops USDC price to $0.95

Oracle reports $0.95 price

DAO receives only 950,000 USDC for 1000 ETH0




Result:

DAO loses $50,000 in value

Attacker buys back USDC at $1.00 after redemption

Attacker profit: $50,000

### Mitigation

 Added minAmountOut Parameter

function redeemDao(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)
    external
    nonReentrant
    whenNotPaused
{
    // ... redemption logic ...
    if (returnedCollateral < minAmountOut) {
        revert AmountTooLow();
    }
}
