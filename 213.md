# LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed lacks Round Validation

### Summary

The missing round validation in `LidoWstEthOracle::getRoundData` allows retrieval of non-existent historical round data with mock timestamps, creating integration compatibility issues for external protocols expecting standard Chainlink behavior. The protocol's core operations remain unaffected as they utilize `latestRoundData()` which functions correctly.
Missing round ID validation in `getRoundData` will cause integration confusion and data inconsistency for external consumers as third-party protocols will receive misleading historical round information.

### Root Cause

In `LidoWstEthOracle.sol::L65`, there is a missing validation check on the roundId_ parameter. The function accepts any round ID input and returns current price data with mock timestamps (block.timestamp) without verifying if the requested round actually exists or contains legitimate historical data.
In case it's a mistake in the code: In LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.sol:62-75 the getRoundData() function lacks round ID validation
Example:

- The function returns mock `startedAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps set to `block.timestamp` for any round ID
- No distinction is made between valid rounds (like round 1) and non-existent rounds (like round 100)
- The returned data appears legitimate but contains no actual historical information

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `LidoWstEthOracle` is deployed and operational
2. External protocols attempt to integrate with the price feed expecting Chainlink-compatible behavior
3. Third-party consumers call `getRoundData()` with various round IDs to access historical data
4. The protocol's core `ClassicalOracle` continues using `latestRoundData()` (unaffected by this issue)

### External Pre-conditions

1

### Attack Path

1. An external protocol integrates the `LidoWstEthOracle` expecting Chainlink-compatible historical data access
2. The external protocol calls getRoundData with say `getRoundData(80)`  to retrieve historical price information for analysis or validation
3. Instead of receiving a revert for a non-existent round, the function returns current price data with mock timestamps making round 80 appear legitimate

### Impact

1.  Misleading Historical Data Causes Faulty Protocol Decisions

### Mitigation

Validate  `getRoundData`
