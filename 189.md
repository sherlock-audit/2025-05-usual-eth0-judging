# CollateralToken Soft-Removal Assumption Is Invalid

### Summary

The protocol assumes that `CollateralTokens` are non-removable by design but can be soft-removed by modifying their price feeds or upgrading oracles. This assumption breaks in the case of  `wstETH`, which inherently increase in value over time. The protocol does not provide a mechanism to capture or extract the accrued yield, leading to potential exploitation during price feed modifications for "soft-remove".




### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the protocolâ€™s handling of [`wstETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L86) as collateral for minting `ETH0`. `wstETH` is a wrapped version of `stETH` that accumulates staking rewards, meaning its value (in terms of ETH) increases over time. The minting process is defined as a 1:1 ratio with respect to `wstETH`, without any mechanism for capturing yield or reclaiming excess collateral.

There is no treasury-side reclaim function or rebalancing logic. Therefore, once `wstETH` appreciates, the treasury holds more value than what was originally issued in `ETH0`. Attempting to "soft-remove" the token via oracle upgrade creates a window for users to redeem `ETH0` at an undervalued rate and extract profit by externally swapping `wstETH`.

In README:

> CollateralTokens are not removable by design, they can however be soft-removed by changing their pricefeed / upgrade.

#### **Illustrative Scenario:**

1. **Initial Minting**

   * 1,000 `ETH0` minted against 1,000 `wstETH`
   * Price: 1 `wstETH` = 1 ETH
   * Treasury holds 1,000 `wstETH` worth 1,000 ETH

2. **After Yield Accrual**

   * 1 `wstETH` now worth 1.2 ETH
   * Treasury now implicitly holds 1,000 `wstETH` = 1,200 ETH

3. **Oracle Upgrade Attempt (Soft-Removal)**

   * Oracle sets 1 `wstETH` = 1 ETH again to soft-remove it ( That's the only way to remove excess collateral by oracle upgrade )
   * User redeems 1,000 `ETH0` for 1,000 `wstETH`
   * Sells 1,000 `wstETH` for 1,200 ETH externally
   * **Net profit**: 200 ETH extracted from protocol


The price feed upgrade is not feasible way to remove excess collateral from treasury.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No needed

### External Pre-conditions

1. Protocol wants to remove excess collateral

### Attack Path

Provided in root cause

### Impact

This issue invalidates the claim that yield-bearing tokens like `wstETH` can be safely soft-removed via oracle upgrade. It technically locks the excess collateral into treasury. Instead, they create persistent value drift that requires active treasury management or withdrawal logic.

### Mitigation

Implement another way to remove excess collateral from treasury
