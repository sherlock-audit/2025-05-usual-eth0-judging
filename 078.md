# Single upstream point of failure leaves protocol vulnerable to depeg-related losses

### Summary

ETH0 relies **solely** on wstETH's `stEthPerToken` function to determine how much ETH0 to mint or how much wstETH to exchange back for ETH0 upon `redeem`. Even small or short term manipulations of Lido internal accounting could have serious consequences for the protocol, as the fallback mechanisms built into the protocol such as having a Chainlink stETH/ETH price feed bot with pausing authority or `_checkDepegPrice` are **insufficient** to protect the protocol. This makes the entire financial security of the protocol dependent on a single, **external** authority -- which may have contain various attack vectors of its own. Attackers could then exploit this to profit on the depegged currency.

### Root Cause

Relying only on `stEthPerToken` to maintain ETH0's peg to wstETH is a mistake because it gives an upstream protocol the entire burden of security, which could spell disaster for the ETH0 protocol.

It may not be clear why this is a single point of failure, as the protocol includes two other failsafes to protect against depegging, but they in fact prove to be futile. The first is the Chainlink stETH/ETH price feed bot which is supposed to pause the protocol if stETH loses its peg. However, since the culprit of the vulnerability is not a price feed but internal reserves accounting done by Lido, `stEthPerToken` could return a problematic calculation without ever affecting the price feeds or causing a depeg, and even if it did, the delay from the off-chain source would be long enough that a malicious actor can already succeed in making his swaps before the pause takes place. Below you can see the logic behind `stEthPerToken`:
[WstETH.sol#L108](https://github.com/lidofinance/core/blob/master/contracts/0.6.12/WstETH.sol#L108)
[StETH.sol#L309](https://github.com/lidofinance/core/blob/master/contracts/0.4.24/StETH.sol#L309)

The second potential line of protection is the `_checkDepegPrice` function, which could in theory be used to protect against this kind of attack, and indeed is part of my recommended mitigation, however when we look at the code we see that the function as it exists should not really be used:

```javascript
function _checkDepegPrice(address token, uint256 wadPriceInETH) internal view {
        AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();

        // Skip the check if the token is not a stablecoin
        if (!$.tokenToOracleInfo[token].isStablecoin) return;

        uint256 threshold = Math.mulDiv($.maxDepegThreshold, SCALAR_ONE, BASIS_POINT_BASE);

        if (wadPriceInETH > SCALAR_ONE + threshold || wadPriceInETH < SCALAR_ONE - threshold) {
            revert StablecoinDepeg();
        }
    }
```

We expect the function to return early, never making use of the depeg threshold, because wstETH is not a stablecoin and the value of wstETH/stETH (or `stEthPerToken`) inherently grows over time. So it should not be classified as a stablecoin. If it was, and a threshold was set for it -- this could have separate consequences as time passes and the value goes up (or if the threshold is large enough to account for a long time horizon, then `stEthPerToken` can still be manipulated within that margin of error).

There are no other mechanisms involved in maintaining the peg of ETH0:wstETH, thus leaving protocol safety entirely in the hands of a single external function, which could be manipulated and would result in breaking the core protocol invariant of having a higher ETH value in the treasury than of ETH0 in circulation (as long as the peg is lost, it will not).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol is unpaused, users are interacting.
2. `stEthPerToken` is the source of truth for the oracle.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Manipulation of `stEthPerToken` takes place in Lido's wstETH.sol contract.

Ex.) stETH/wstETH becomes 5 instead of 1.2

### Attack Path

As an example:

1. Attacker acquires 10 wstETH

2. Lido's `stEthPerToken` manipulated, ETH0 miscalculates collateral value

   -> ETH0 uses the new stEthPerToken() = 5.00.

   ->ETH0 now believes 10 wstETH should mint 50 ETH

3. Attacker mints 50 ETH0 tokens using only 10 wstETH

4. 
[OPTION A] If `stEthPerToken` quickly returns to it's normal peg, attacker redeems ETH0 and drains treasury for 50ETH (in wstETH).
[OPTION B] If `stEthPerToken` would remain manipulated long enough for a manual pause, attacker quickly exchanges his ETH0 on a DEX -- and ETH0 protocol remains broken.

### Impact

If Lido's `stEthPerToken` function is compromised, users can mint more ETH0 than they should — causing the system to become undercollateralized.

Because ETH0 trusts this value without any independent validation, an attacker could mint ETH0 tokens with far less wstETH than required, extract value via redemptions or AMM sales, and leave the protocol with insufficient collateral. Even a short-lived manipulation could cause permanent damage.

ETH0 can:
1. Become undercollateralized or insolvent,
2. Lose its peg,
3. Causing direct financial loss to ETH0 holders and the protocol itself.

This breaks ETH0’s core 1:1 peg guarantee.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Check for potentially catastrophic/malicious deviations in oracle prices for non-stablecoin collateral in `AbstractOracle::_checkDepegPrice`.
2. Use TWAP validations of oracle pricing from other on chain sources to remove the single point of failure.
