# Protocol will cause a usability issue for users

### Summary

The missing validation in the `initialize` function will cause a usability issue for users as the protocol will deploy a token with no name or symbol.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0-Phantom-Fort/tree/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `initialize` function is called with empty strings for `name_` or `symbol_`.

### External Pre-conditions

null

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

The users cannot easily identify the token due to the lack of a name or symbol, leading to confusion and reduced trust in the protocol.


### PoC

No proof of concept is provided as this is a usability issue rather than an exploitable vulnerability.


### Mitigation


Add validation in the `initialize` function to ensure `name_` and `symbol_` are not empty:

```solidity
if (bytes(name_).length == 0 || bytes(symbol_).length == 0) {
    revert InvalidTokenDetails();
}
