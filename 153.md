# Check enforcing that ETH0 < CollateralETHValue is wrong due to incorrect order of operations and can break invariant

### Summary

The protocol has these invariants:
"We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury. "

"ETH0 minting is not allowed if it is not backed by at least the same ETH amount of collateralTokens"

The `Eth0` contract `mint` function is responsible for enforcing the protections that ensure these invariants are abided by and not broken. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L162-L163

However, when users `redeem` in `DAOCollateral` and the protocol mints ETH0 for the fee, the order of operations between the `DaoCollateral` and `ETH0` contracts in the `redeem` flow will lead to an incorrect and very inflated ETH value of collateral being used for this requirement. Which, under certain conditions will completely break the invariant, and will allow the minting of ETH0 even if there will be 0 collateral to back it.

### Root Cause

In `DaoCollateral` `redeem` - the function is responsible for burning the amount of Eth0 the user is redeeming, taking a fee of that Eth0 and minting the fee amount to the treasury, and then transferring to the user collateral. For the `burning` and `minting` , the `DaoCollateral` will call `Eth0` to fulfill these actions, and `Eth0` will be responsible for enforcing the checks that protect the invariants.

However, the order of operations will have the state incomplete at the time that the check requiring that there is more ETH value of collateral than ETH0 minted. It is important to note (when looking at the attack section) that this check will be wrong in every situation even when exchange rates are perfectly 1 : 1 - but is extremely dangerous under certain scenarios / conditions.

The ETH value of collateral will be very inflated and will allow the check to pass and more ETH0 to be minted, when it shouldnt be allowed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. No internal pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

1. wstETH loses value against ETH 
2. OR, when other LST's are incorporated as collateral, and they lose some value against ETH and their exchange ratio drops below 1 : 1


### Attack Path

** Lets say a user initially deposits 10 wstETH at an exchange ratio of 1 : 1 with ETH, and is minted 10 ETH0. 
So the beginning state is: totalSupply = 10 ETH0 ; totalCollateral value in eth = 10 , collateral = 10 wstETH

1. wstETH loses value against ETH, and is at an exchange ratio of 1 : 0.8 ; 1 wstETH = 0.8 ETH

** It is important to note that contest page refers to a chainlink bot that will pause DAO Collateral, but it states that it will only pause DaoCollateral if Lido is hacked. 

2. User calls `redeem` in `DaoCollateral` and redeems all 10 ETH0;

3. `redeem` will call `_calculateFee` which will take the fee percentage of ETH0 (lets assume the fee is 20%, which the protocol max fee is 25% so this is within the bounds of the protocol) :

```solidity
    function _calculateFee(uint256 eth0Amount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 stableFee)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();

        stableFee = Math.mulDiv(eth0Amount, $.redeemFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
```

** 20% of the 10 ETH0 being redeemed will result in `stableFee` = 2

4. `_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral` is called and is responsible for burning the ETH0, minting the fee amount of ETH0, calculating the wstETH amount to transfer to the user and then transferring it to the user - IN THIS EXACT ORDER.

```solidity
   function _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 eth0Amount,
        uint256 stableFee
    ) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
     
        // we burn the remaining ETH0 token
        uint256 burnedEth0 = eth0Amount - stableFee;

        // we burn all the ETH0 token
->        $.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount);

        // If the CBR is on, the fees are forfeited from the yield treasury to favor the collateralization ratio
        if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn) {
  ->          $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee);
        }
        returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(burnedEth0, collateralToken);
        if (returnedCollateral == 0) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }

        // we distribute the collateral token from the treasury to the user
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20
        IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
```

5. When this function calls `mint` to mint the 2 ETH0 fee amount, the 10 ETH0 amount has ALREADY been burned. Lets examine the `mint` function call in `Eth0.sol` : 

```solidity
   function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {

        // Check if minting would exceed the mint cap
        if (totalSupply() + amount > $.mintCap) {
            revert AmountExceedCap();
        }

->        address[] memory collateralTokens = $.tokenMapping.getAllEth0CollateralTokens();

        uint256 wadCollateralBackingInETH = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateralTokens.length;) {
            address collateralToken = collateralTokens[i];
            uint256 collateralTokenPriceInETH = uint256(oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
            uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals();
    
  ->          wadCollateralBackingInETH += Math.mulDiv(
                collateralTokenPriceInETH,
 ->               IERC20(collateralToken).balanceOf(treasury),
                10 ** decimals
            );

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        // @audit WRONG CHECK !! This balance includes the wstETH balance that is being redeemed,
        // @audit so this is an inflated value. at this time in redeem flow the total collateral ETH value is 8 
        // @audit needs to reduce `wadCollateralBackingInETH` by the the ETH value of wstETH being redeemed

->         if (totalSupply() + amount > wadCollateralBackingInETH) {
            revert AmountExceedBacking();
        }
->        _mint(to, amount);
    }
```

Lets walk through the state at the time this is called:
- This function is called in an effort to mint 2 ETH0 
- The initial 10 Eth0 to be redeemed was reduced by 2 (fee) so the remaining eth0 the user is redeeming is 8 eth0
- No collateral has been transferred out, so the ETH value of all collateral is still based on the initial 10 wstETH (which is now 1 : 0.8 exchange rate to eth) so the ETH value of the total collateral is 8.
- ALL of the users 10 Eth0 has been burned, so `totalSupply` is 0.

1. the function gets an array of all of the collateral tokens (in this case it is just wstETH) 
2. calculates the ETH value of the total collateral in the treasury by:
- Getting the price in ETH of wstETH -> which is 0.8 
- using the CURRENT wstETH BALANCE of the treasury via `balanceOf` -> This balance still has the full amount of wstETH that was initially deposited and it DOES NOT adjust it for the amount of collateral that will be transferred out when the (Eth0 that the user is redeeming - the fee) is redeemed. THIS IS AN INFLATED AND WRONG VALUE 
3. calculating the `wadCollateralBackingInETH` will return a value of 8.
4. The following check is made :
`if (0 + 2 > 8)`

*but this will succeed. 

5. 2 Eth0 tokens will be minted.

The next steps in the `redeem` flow will transfer out the collateral wstETH to the user, but first it will calculate the amount of wstETH to send to the user by using the wstETH / ETH price which is 1 : 0.8: It is important to note that the price is returned as the wstETH price IN ETH, which will be 1 : 0.8 exchange rate.

6. 3 functions are called, to get the price of wstETH / ETH, and then to calculate the amount of wstETH to transfer to user, we will jump to the `normalize` contract which is responsible for calculating that value. The amount of wstETH to transfer will be calculated based off of 8 ETh0 and wstETH price of 0.8 ETH

```solidity
    function wadTokenAmountForPrice(uint256 wadStableAmount, uint256 wadPrice, uint8 tokenDecimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return Math.mulDiv(wadStableAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals, wadPrice, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }
```

** This calculation will divide the 10 ETH0 by the price of 0.8 -> which will result in 10 wstETH to be transferred.

The `redeem` function will then transfer the 10 wstETH to the user.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L496

** So, at the end of the `redeem` flow:
- All 10 wstETH has been transferred out of the treasury, the treasury now has 0 ETH value of collateral 
- 2 ETH0 is minted and in circulation. 
- the totalSupply of ETH0 is 2, while there is 0 eth value of collateral
- the Invariant is broken


### Impact

The protocol will suffer insolvency as there is 0 wstETH collateral and 0 ETH value of collateral held within the treasury.

The Invariant will be broken as there will be 2 ETH0 minted, with less than that amount of collateral value in ETH backing it.

There is more ETH0 than corresponding ETH value of collateral in the treasury, and ETH0 minting was allowed even though there was not going to be enough collateral to back it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either the order of operations needs to be changed to where the wstETH amount is calculated and transferred to the user BEFORE the minting of ETH0 fee so that the check as currently is (uses `balanceOf(treasury) ) will be accurate.

Or, calculate the wstETH amount and deduct it from the `wadCollateralBackingInEth` value in the `mint` function to perform the correct check.
