# swapWithPermit() fails to enforce permit() success, enabling replay attacks and breaking atomicity

### Summary

The swapWithPermit() function enables a user to grant ERC-20 allowance using an EIP-2612 signature and then immediately perform a token swap. However, if the permit() call fails — due to an expired deadline, invalid signature, or incorrect nonce — the contract currently does not revert or enforce that the permit succeeded.

Instead, the function may silently ignore the failed permit() call (e.g., through try/catch or omission of error handling), leading to several issues:

### Root Cause

In DaoCollateral.sol:swapWithPermit(), the result of the IERC20Permit.permit() call is not enforced. If the permit() call fails due to signature expiry, incorrect nonce, or invalid parameters, the contract does not revert and may continue with the swap execution — relying on outdated or non-existent allowances.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user calls swapWithPermit() using a signature (v, r, s) generated via permit() over collateralToken.

The allowance from user to contract must be zero prior to this call.

The signature is expired, has an invalid nonce, or is otherwise invalid.

### External Pre-conditions

The underlying IERC20Permit token (e.g., USDC, DAI) implements EIP-2612 permit() correctly.

The EVM does not revert when calling permit() with invalid inputs (as it may silently fail depending on implementation).

The oracle rate or swap pool used by swap() does not require exact approvals for slippage to succeed.

### Attack Path

The user signs a permit() with a short deadline or for a wrong nonce.

The attacker (malicious relayer or frontend) submits this signature in swapWithPermit().

The call to permit() fails due to expired deadline or incorrect nonce.

The contract catches the failure and continues.

The swap fails later at transferFrom() due to missing allowance, wasting user gas despite appearing to succeed.

Alternatively, if a stale approval exists (from previous unrelated usage), the function succeeds in using that, leading to unexpected token transfer by the user.



### Impact

The user suffers a loss of trust and UX failure, potentially wasting up to full gas costs.

A replay attack is possible if old signatures are reused and passed to swapWithPermit() without enforcement.

The protocol violates atomicity guarantees — approval and swap are no longer guaranteed to occur together.

In extreme cases, signatures could be brute-forced or social engineered to reuse outdated approvals unintentionally.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require success of permit() explicitly:

IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
    msg.sender,
    address(this),
    amount,
    deadline,
    v, r, s
);
Or — if wrapped in try/catch:


try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(...) {
    // nothing needed here
} catch {
    revert("Permit failed");
}
Also consider checking allowance before proceeding with transferFrom() if permit() is optional.
