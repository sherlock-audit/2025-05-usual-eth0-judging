# Front-running `blacklist()` with a `redeem()` or `transfer()` to prevent getting blacklisted

### Summary

Front-running `blacklist()` with a `redeem()` prevents users from getting blacklisted, rendering the blacklisting logic useless.

### Root Cause

The blacklisting logic can become useless, since attackers can front-run [`blacklist()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L229) transactions with a redeem, get back their collateral tokens, and then send the collateral to another address, from which they call `swap()` to get ETH0, effectively preventing getting blacklisted. (or they can front-run it with a direct `transfer()`).

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin wants to blacklist an address.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `Eth0::blacklist()` on the attacker's address.
2. Attacker is monitoring the mempool, sees `blacklist()` being called on his address.
3. Attacker quickly calls `DaoCollateral::redeem()` to get back his collateral tokens, or he directly calls `Eth0::transfer()` to transfer funds to another address which he controls.
4. `blacklist()` gets mined, but the tokens are already gone.
5. The attacker could had sent them to another address, or he could had redeemed them. 
6. In the first case, the attacker can sell them in a DEX.
7. In the second case, he can call `swap()` again and get ETH0 again with the address that isn't blacklisted.

### Impact
- Attacker retains control of funds that were meant to be frozen.
- Can render the blacklist logic useless, as it can happen everytime.
- Risk by giving flexibility to malicious actors since they can prevent getting blacklisted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I'd recommend pausing transfers right before blacklisting an address.
