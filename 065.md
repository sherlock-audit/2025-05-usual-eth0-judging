# Redeem Function Always Reverts Due to Missing Treasury Allowance

### Summary

Every call to `redeem(...)` fails because the contract attempts to “pull” collateral from the treasury without any ERC20 allowance. Although the code burns ETH0 first, the subsequent `safeTransferFrom(treasury, …)` always reverts. Because reverts roll back the entire transaction, redeem(...) can never succeed—users cannot redeem ETH0 for collateral.

### Root Cause

In `_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral`, the contract calls:

```solidity
$.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount);
....
IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
```

The treasury address never granted this contract permission to move its collateral tokens. Therefore, `safeTransferFrom(treasury, …)` always reverts, undoing the prior burn and causing the entire `redeem(...)` call to fail.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

The treasury address has never executed `approve(collateralToken, DaoCollateralAddress, returnedCollateral)`. In fact, no code in this contract ever sets or requires that allowance.

### Attack Path

None 

### Impact

Because every `redeem(...)` call reverts, users cannot swap ETH0 back into collateral. ETH0 effectively becomes locked—users can mint ETH0 via swap(...), but cannot exit through `redeem(...)`.
