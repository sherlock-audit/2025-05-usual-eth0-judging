# The `pauser`role is useless in the ETH0 contract, and they can never actually pause

### Summary

Given the emergency necessity of the ability to pause the ETH0 contract, and the clear intention to implement the pause functionality by importing and inheriting `ERC20PauseableUpgradeable` - it is a problem that the `ETH0` contract does not have the ability to pause any of the critical functions because it does not correctly implement the `pause` feature.

Therefore, `mint` , `burn` , `burnFrom` will never be able to be paused in times of emergency despite the fact that the `ETH0` contract inherits `ERC20PauseableUpgradeable` 

### Root Cause

The protocol inherits `ERC20PauseableUpgradeable` which extends the feature of pausing during emergency situatuions, or any situation deemed necessary for protocol health and solvency:

```solidity
contract Eth0 is ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20PermitUpgradeable, IEth0 {
```

`ETH0` has a specific role for both `pausing` and `unpausing` - and it also correctly implements the external `pause` and `unpause` functions - which are restricted to being called by their respective roles:

```solidity
    function pause() external {
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(PAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE);
        _pause();
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IEth0
    function unpause() external {
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE);
        _unpause();
    }
```


BUT even though the `pauser` role can call the external `pause` function - which will set the state of the protocol to `paused` - it will not be enforced unless each critical function has the `whenNotPaused` modifier attached to it - WHICH NONE DO.

So, none of the critical functions in `ETH0` can be paused even when the `pauser` role sets the state of the contract to paused - rendering the `pauser` role powerless and the pausing functionality useless.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. None 

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol is in a state of emergency and needs to pause the `ETH0` contract, the `pauser` role calls `pause` to set the state of the contract to `paused` - but none of the critical functions will actually stop running.

### Attack Path

1. The protocol enters an undesired state in which minting / burning will only cause more damage and needs to be paused temporarily 
2. The `pauser` role calls `pause` and sets the state of `ETH0` to paused.
3. `Mint` and `burn` / `burnFrom` are still called and execute the actions despite the attempt to `pause` the ETH0 contract

### Impact

The `ETH0` contract will continue to `mint` and `burn` tokens despite the emergency situation which requires those critical functions to be halted to preserve the health of the asset - which will lead to expedited unintended consequences.

The `pauser` role is useless and powerless and can never actually pause any of the critical functionality of the protocol. 

### PoC

The `mint` `burn` and `burnFrom` functions can never be halted when the `pauser` intends to set the `ETH0` state to paused.

### Mitigation

Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the critical functionality of `ETH0` to enable the ability to pause the contract in times of emergency.
