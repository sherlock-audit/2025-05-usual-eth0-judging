# A user can re-enter `swapPermit` with a collateral token with a callBack

## Summary
When swapPermit is called it takes in any collateral token allowing users to pass in a collateral with callBack to redeem more tokens from the protocol than swapped.
## Description
```solidity
    function swapWithPermit(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
        try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
            msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
        ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    }
```
As we can see when swapping with permit it fails to validate collateral token or add a non re-entrant modifier allowing attacker to exploit this by crafting a contract to re-enter this function.

## Attack Path 
1. User craft a malicious re-entrant call contract.
2. It calls swapPermit() with a callback that calls swapPermit() again withesame amount
3. It then finishes calling redeem with a high amount allowing him to withdraw more than asset swapped for
4. ## Impact
Tokens can be stolen from the protocol
## Recommended Mitigation
I think we should add the `nonReentrant` modifier to the swapPermit
