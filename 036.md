# `LidoWstEthOracle` does not provide actual ETH price per wstETH

## Vulnerability Details

In `DaoCollateral`, users would swap their equivalent amount of `wstETH` which will be collaterized and backs the amount of subsequent `Eth0` minted to them. The problem arises when the actual amount of `Eth0` minted to them is actually the amount of `stETH` value instead of the amount of `ETH` value of the `wstETH`.

This means the amount of `Eth0` will be more than the corresponding `ETH` value inside the treasury.

In `LidoWstEthOracle.latestRoundData`

```solidity
    function latestRoundData()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        )
    {
        // Return mock data for all fields except answer
        roundId = 1;
@>        answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken()); // @audit token price is in terms of stETH
        startedAt = block.timestamp;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        answeredInRound = 1;
    }
```

In `DaoCollateral._transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0`

```solidity
    function _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 wadAmountInETH0
    ) internal {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        // Should revert if balance is insufficient
@>        IERC20Metadata(address(collateralToken)).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, $.treasury, amount); // @audit amount minted is base on stETH / wstETH price instead of ETH / wstETH price 
        // Mint some ETH0
        $.eth0.mint(msg.sender, wadAmountInETH0);
    }
```

## POC

Consider the following scenario

1. The current price of stETH to wstETH is 1.20.
2. Bob performs a swap via `DaoCollateral.swap` using 1 wstETH through DaoCollateral.swap.
3. In return, he receives 1.2 ETH0 (valued in stETH).
4. However, if 1 wstETH equals 1.2 stETH, which is equivalent to 1.19904 ETH (assuming a rate of 0.9992), the `Eth0` will be backed by a lower ETH value.
5. Since the `Eth0.mint` function also verifies that the amount of `Eth0` minted does not exceed the value in `stETH` to permit minting, the 1.2 `Eth0` issued to Bob will be backed by 1 `wstETH`, which equals 1.2 `stETH`, translating to 1.19904 `ETH` worth of tokens.
6. In the end, there will be more `Eth0` than the corresponding `Eth` value in the treasury


## Root Cause

`LidoWstEthOracle` does not convertthe price of stETH to ETH prior to providing the price in `DaoCollateral`.

## Impact

Above scenario breaks the invariant. There will always be more Eth0 than the corresponding Eth value in treasury

> We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury.

> ETH0 minting is not allowed if it is not backed by at least the same ETH amount of collateralTokens,

## Mitigation

Consider adjusting `LidoWstETHOracle` to convert the `stETH` price to `ETH` (using Chainlink oracles) prior to utilizing it in `DaoCollateral`.
