# Failed transactions would be caught in infinite loop when swapPermit

## Summary
The swapPermit is sswap method with permit function that enable you to swap your collateralToken for stablecoin with permit will exchange LST (collateralToken) for ETH0 (stableToken). However it fails to revert failed swaps putting users in infinite loop for failed requests
## Description
```solidity
    function swapWithPermit(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
        try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
            msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
 @>       ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    }
```
As we can see any issue that would make request fail would put the user in an inifinte loop of calls till gas is exhausted from the user. 
## Impact
Honest users transaction would be stuck in loop till gas is exhausted

## Recommended Mitigation
Revert failed permit requests
