In general, ETH per LST (Liquid Staking Token) or LRT (Liquid Restaking Token) will continue to rise over time, as staking rewards accumulate and are reflected in the conversion rate. In this case, the LST is wstETH.

Currently, one (1) wstETH is worth 1.2 ETH. As time goes on, the price of a single wstETH will increase to 1.3, 1.5, 2.0 ETH, and so on.

When fetching the price of the LST/LRT, the `getPrice()` function is called, which will execute the `_checkDepegPrice()` function to check for depeg and revert if depeg is detected.

```solidity
File: AbstractOracle.sol
102:     /// @inheritdoc IOracle
103:     function getPrice(address token) public view override returns (uint256) {
104:         (uint256 price, uint256 decimalsPrice) = _latestRoundData(token);
105:         price = price.tokenAmountToWad(uint8(decimalsPrice));
106:         _checkDepegPrice(token, price);
107:         return price;
108:     }
```

```solidity
File: AbstractOracle.sol
134:     function _checkDepegPrice(address token, uint256 wadPriceInETH) internal view {
135:         AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();
136: 
137:         // Skip the check if the token is not a stablecoin
138:         if (!$.tokenToOracleInfo[token].isStablecoin) return;
139: 
140:         uint256 threshold = Math.mulDiv($.maxDepegThreshold, SCALAR_ONE, BASIS_POINT_BASE);
141: 
142:         if (wadPriceInETH > SCALAR_ONE + threshold || wadPriceInETH < SCALAR_ONE - threshold) {
143:             revert StablecoinDepeg();
144:         }
145:     }
```

The issue is that this depeg check is a relic from USD0 and is not relevant for ETH0. In USD0, the value of the collateral (e.g., USDY, M^0) usually hovers around 1 USD as they are stable coins by nature. Thus, if the price of collateral (e.g., USDY) becomes 1.21 (threshold = 20%), some serious depegging event has occurred, and the protocol should revert the transaction to halt further transactions from being executed.

However, the value/price of ETH-denominated collateral (e.g., wstETH, rETH) does not hover around 1 ETH or pegged around 1 ETH. As mentioned earlier, the price will increase monotonically (e.g., 1.2, 1.5, 2.0...) unless some significant slashing or catastrophic failure event occurs.

Assume that the threshold is set to 30%. If the price of ETH-denominated collateral (e.g., wstETH) exceeds 1.3 ETH, it will revert. 

Assume the current price is 1.2 ETH per wstETH.  The issue here is that eventually, the price of wstETH will grow and exceed the threshold (price > 1.3 ETH). When this occurs, the `getPrice()` function will revert.

As a result, the protocol will be broken because all operations involve fetching the collateral price via the `getPrice()` function, and all operations will be DOSed. No one can deposit, redeem, or swap their assets.

### Impact

Loss of assets and protocol will be broken. 

The protocol will be broken because all operations involve the fetching of collateral price via the `getPrice()` function, and all operations will be DOSed. No one can deposit, redeem, or swap their assets.

The holder of ETH0 cannot redeem their assets. No fee can be collected because the protocol is bricked, leading to a loss of the fee for the protocol and the USUAL holder.
