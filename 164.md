# CBR Coefficient Abuse

### Summary

The activateCBR function in the DaoCollateral contract allows an admin with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to activate the Counter Bank Run (CBR) mode and set a coefficient (cbrCoef) that scales down the collateral returned to users during redemption. This poses a centralization risk, as a malicious or compromised admin could set an extremely low coefficient, reducing user collateral returns to nearly zero while retaining most of the collateral in the treasury. The absence of constraints like a minimum coefficient or decentralized governance mechanisms amplifies this vulnerability, potentially causing significant financial harm to users and damaging trust in the protocol.

### Root Cause

The activateCBR function permits the admin to set any cbrCoef value between 1 and SCALAR_ONE (1e18), with no meaningful lower bound beyond zero.This flexibility allows the admin to specify a cbrCoef as low as 1 wei, severely reducing the collateral returned to users during redemption.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin Role: The caller must have the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, verified by _requireOnlyAdmin() via registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE).
CBR Inactive: While not explicitly checked, isCBROn is typically false before activation, though the function overwrites it to true.
Valid Coefficient: The coefficient must be between 1 and SCALAR_ONE (1e18), as enforced by the function’s input validation.

### External Pre-conditions

Admin Compromise: The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE could be compromised through private key theft, social engineering, or governance weaknesses.
User Unawareness: Users may not actively monitor isCBROn or cbrCoef, leaving them vulnerable to unexpected redemption losses.

### Attack Path

A malicious actor gains control of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.
The actor calls activateCBR with a minimal coefficient, setting isCBROn = true and cbrCoef = 1e18.
During redemption via redeem(), the _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH function applies the cbrCoef multiplier, returning near-zero collateral to users.
The attacker could potentially extract the retained collateral from the treasury, profiting at users’ expense.

### Impact

Financial Loss: When redeeming Eth0 tokens, users receive collateral scaled by cbrCoef / SCALAR_ONE. A cbrCoef of 1e18.
Protocol Disruption: CBR activation pauses swaps, isolating the redemption process and preventing new collateral inflows, exacerbating the issue.
Reputational Damage: Such centralization and potential exploitation could undermine user confidence, reducing adoption and credibility of the protocol.

    }

    function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) external view returns (bool) {
        return roles[role][account];

}

### Mitigation

Minimum Coefficient: Set a reasonable lower bound for cbrCoef (0.5e18) to limit collateral reduction.
