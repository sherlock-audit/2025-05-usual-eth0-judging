# Invariant Violation, ETH0 Minting Can Become Undercollateralized After Oracle Price Drop

### Summary

The system guarantees that every minted ETH0 must be backed 1:1 by ETH-denominated collateral, typically represented by `wstETH` held in treasury. However, the current minting logic uses `stEthPerToken` an on-chain exchange rate between `wstETH` and `stETH` assuming this value always increases or remains constant. This assumption is incorrect due to potential slashing events affecting Lido validators, which may cause `stEthPerToken` to decrease.

As a result, ETH0 minting can occur at a 1:1 ratio using an inflated `stEthPerToken`, leading to undercollateralization if the rate drops.

### Root Cause

#### Protocol invariant:

> Q: What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?
We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury.

> ETH0 minting is not allowed if it is not backed by at least the same ETH amount of collateralTokens,

> e.g. When assuming 1 eth == 1 $stEth then: If ETH0 total supply is 10 we should have at least 10 $stETH worth of $wstETH in the collateral treasury as a condition to allow to mint more ETH0.

Usual currently adopts Aave's method for pricing `wstETH`, relying on the `stEthPerToken` rate to determine collateral value. While this approach is appropriate for Aave a lending protocol with conservative risk parameters it introduces risk in Usualâ€™s context. Aave enforces an 81% liquidation threshold and a 6% liquidator incentive, ensuring that collateral value always exceeds borrowed value by design. This buffer makes it safe for Aave to rely on `stEthPerToken`, even in the event of slashing. In contrast, Usual allows 1:1 minting of ETH0 against `wstETH`, with no overcollateralization or liquidation mechanics. As a result, using the same price source without accounting for potential price drops (e.g., from slashing events) exposes Usual to undercollateralization risk and breaks its core collateralization invariant.

The function `_swapCheckAndGetETHQuote()` relies on [`stEthPerToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L66) to determine how much ETH0 to mint in exchange for incoming `wstETH`. This value is dynamic and represents the `stETH` claimable per unit of `wstETH`. However, this metric can decrease due to validator slashing, contrary to the assumption encoded in the system.

This quote is assumed to be equivalent to the ETH-denominated value of incoming collateral. However, no historical verification exists to account for sudden reductions in `stEthPerToken`.

Per [Lido documentation](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide#slashing-risk), slashing events are explicitly acknowledged as a source of risk to `stETH` value.


### Internal Pre-conditions

No needed

### External Pre-conditions

1. Lido oracle should report a loss

### Attack Path

1. Let say `stEthPerToken` = 1.20
2. User swap 100 wstETH for 120 ETH0
3. Oracle reported a loss in Lido and now `stEthPerToken` = 1.19
4. Now, 120 ETH0 will be backed against 119 worth of ETH
5. Also swap will still continue allow execution

### Impact

* **Invariant Violation:** The invariant that ETH0 must never exceed the ETH value of treasury-held collateral is broken.
* **Undercollateralization Risk:** A drop in `stEthPerToken` after minting leads to a mismatch between ETH0 supply and underlying backing, causing solvency issues.

Due to insolvency, redeem operation won't work for the last user who wants to redeem their wstETH back.

### Mitigation

Do not allow 1:1 minting especially for wstETH, always leave a buffer to cover this kind of price drops.
