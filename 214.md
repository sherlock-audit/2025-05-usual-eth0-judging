# Missing Collateral Token Removal Function in TokenMapping.sol will put the protocol under water in the case of collateral token depeg

### Summary

The TokenMapping.sol contract contains an addEth0CollateralToken function that allows administrators to add up to MAX_COLLATERAL_TOKEN_COUNT (currently 10) collateral tokens. However, there is no corresponding removeEth0CollateralToken function. This omission prevents administrators from removing a collateral token once it has been added. 

If for any reason one, more or all collateral tokens depeg (this is crypto, it will happen at some point probably), the protocol will go under water. The only way to change the remove the now-sunk collateral tokens and add new ones is to upgrade the contract, which, while providing some protection, it still will take too much time compared to having a remove function. During that time where no new collateral tokens are added to back up the protocol, the protocol will go under water and face losses.

### Details

If the maximum number of collateral tokens (10) has been reached, and one or more of these tokens significantly depeg, administrators will be unable to remove the compromised or "sunk" tokens. This directly impacts the collateralization ratio of eth0, as the system remains burdened with depegged assets, potentially breaking the eth0 peg â€“ a critical protocol invariant.

### Likelihood & Impact
Likelihood: Low to Medium. While simultaneous depegging of multiple assets might be low, the need to remove a single underperforming or strategically obsolete token is a plausible scenario over time, especially if the maximum capacity is reached.

Impact: Critical. The inability to adjust collateral effectively threatens the stability of the eth0 peg, which is fundamental to the protocol's integrity and user trust.
