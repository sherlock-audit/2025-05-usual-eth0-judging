# Attacker can dos the usage of swapWithPermit() due to permit()

### Summary

An attacker can DOS the usage of all transactions used in swapWithPermit() in DaoCollateral.sol because the usage of permit() on the collateral token.

### Root Cause

In the usage of permit() here.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L531

The signature used is public in the mempool and an attacker frontrun it can call the same permit() signature to the collateral token himself, resulting in the nonce being incremented and the true transaction failing.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1- user calls swapWithPermit()
2-Function calls the permit()
3-Attacker calls permit() with the same signature extracted from the mempool
4- Nonce of the signature gets incremented
5- original transaction will revert
6- DOS on the function

### Impact

DOS on the swapWithPermit() function
