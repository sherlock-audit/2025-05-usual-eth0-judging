# Lack of transaction deadline will lead to user funds loss due to mempool delays

### Summary

The [`swap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L504-L518) function doesn't have a deadline parameter. This parameter can provide the user an option to limit the execution of their pending transaction. Without a deadline parameter, users can execute their transactions at unexpected times when market conditions are unfavorable.

### Root Cause

In DaoCollateral.sol, the `swap()` function lacks a deadline parameter, which means there's no time limit for when the transaction must be executed:

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IDaoCollateral
    function swap(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)
        public
        nonReentrant
        whenSwapNotPaused
        whenNotPaused
    {
        uint256 wadQuoteInETH = _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote(collateralToken, amount);
        // Check if the amount is greater than the minAmountOut
        if (wadQuoteInETH < minAmountOut) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }

        _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0(collateralToken, amount, wadQuoteInETH);
        emit Swap(msg.sender, collateralToken, amount, wadQuoteInETH);
    }
```

While the function includes a parameter for slippage protection, the lack of a deadline means that transactions can remain pending in the mempool indefinitely and still be executed regardless of how market conditions have changed. `minAmountOut`


### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. User call `swap()` 
2. Network congestion or high gas prices cause transaction delays
3. Market conditions need to change significantly, causing oracle price updates


### Attack Path

1. User submits a transaction to swap 1 WSTETH for ETH0 when the price is 1 ETH
2. The transaction gets stuck in the mempool due to network congestion or low gas price
3. During this time, the market price of WSTETH drops significantly (eg by 10%)
4. The transaction is eventually executed at the new, lower price
5. User receives 10% less ETH0 than they expected at the time of transaction submission


### Impact

The users of the protocol suffer unpredictable losses based on the volatility of the collateral token during transaction delays. In periods of high volatility or market crashes, these losses could be substantial (up to 30% or more of transaction value). This vulnerability also makes the protocol susceptible to MEV sandwich attacks where attackers can manipulate prices before and after a user's transaction.
For a protocol handling significant funds, even a modest 5-10% price swing during transaction delays could translate to thousands or millions of dollars in user losses.


### PoC

paste this in the DaoCollateral.t.sol:

```solidity
function testSwapMempoolDelay() public {
        // Arrange - Setup test environment
        (address wsteth, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwaLido();

        // Set initial price: 1 WSTETH = 1 ETH
        _setOraclePrice(wsteth, 1e18);
        uint256 initialPrice = classicalOracle.getPrice(wsteth);
        assertEq(initialPrice, 1e18, "Initial price should be 1e18");

        // Mint WSTETH directly to Bob instead of transfer
        uint256 initialAmount = 1e18; // 1 WSTETH

        // Use Foundry's cheatcode to set WSTETH balance for Bob
        // First find the balance slot for WSTETH token
        uint256 slot = 0;

        // The WSTETH Forked contract's balanceOf slot
        bytes32 balanceSlot = keccak256(abi.encode(bob, uint256(0)));
        vm.store(wsteth, balanceSlot, bytes32(uint256(initialAmount)));

        // Verify Bob has the tokens
        assertEq(IERC20(wsteth).balanceOf(bob), initialAmount, "Bob should have 1 WSTETH");

        // Bob approves tokens for DaoCollateral
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        IERC20(wsteth).approve(address(daoCollateral), initialAmount);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Calculate expected ETH0 output at initial price
        uint256 expectedOutput = initialAmount * initialPrice / 1e18;

        // Now simulate time passing and price changing while tx is in mempool
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);

        // Price crashes by 50%
        uint256 newPrice = initialPrice / 2; // 0.5 ETH
        _setOraclePrice(wsteth, newPrice);

        // Also need to give the treasury contract enough WSTETH for the swap
        vm.store(wsteth, keccak256(abi.encode(treasury, uint256(0))), bytes32(uint256(initialAmount * 10)));

        // Now Bob's transaction executes with the new price
        vm.prank(bob);
        daoCollateral.swap(wsteth, initialAmount, 0); // minAmountOut = 0 means accept any price

        // Check what Bob actually received
        uint256 receivedAmount = stbc.balanceOf(bob);

        // Calculate the loss due to delay
        uint256 loss = expectedOutput - receivedAmount;

        // Log the results
        console.log("Expected ETH0 at initial price:", expectedOutput);
        console.log("Actual ETH0 received after price drop:", receivedAmount);
        console.log("Loss due to mempool delay:", loss);

        // Verify the impact - received amount should be half of expected
        assertEq(receivedAmount, initialAmount * newPrice / 1e18, "Should receive amount based on new price");
        assertGt(loss, 0, "Should have suffered a loss due to price change");
        assertEq(loss, initialAmount / 2, "Should lose 50% due to price drop");
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add a deadline parameter to the `swap()` function and implement a check that reverts if the current timestamp exceeds this deadline:


```solidity
function swap(
    address collateralToken,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint256 deadline
) public nonReentrant whenSwapNotPaused whenNotPaused {
    if (block.timestamp > deadline) {
        revert TransactionExpired();
    }
    
    uint256 wadQuoteInETH = _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote(collateralToken, amount);
    if (wadQuoteInETH < minAmountOut) {
        revert AmountTooLow();
    }

    _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0(collateralToken, amount, wadQuoteInETH);
    emit Swap(msg.sender, collateralToken, amount, wadQuoteInETH);
}
```

This pattern is already implemented in the `swapWithPermit()` function, but only for the permit portion of the transaction. The deadline protection should be extended to the swap operation itself.
