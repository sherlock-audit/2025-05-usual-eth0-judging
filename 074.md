# Blacklisted User Access Control Vulnerability in Eth0Token

### Summary

A critical access control vulnerability was identified in the `Eth0Token` contract, allowing a blacklisted user to call the `setMintCap` function and modify the protocol’s minting cap. This bypasses the intended blacklist mechanism, which should prevent blacklisted users from performing privileged actions. The vulnerability was confirmed through the `testSetMintCap` test in `ClassicalOracleTest.sol`, which passed, demonstrating that a blacklisted user can successfully update the minting cap.

### Root Cause

The `Eth0Token` contract includes a blacklist mechanism to restrict certain addresses from interacting with the contract. However, the `setMintCap` function, which controls the maximum amount of tokens that can be minted, does not check whether the caller is blacklisted. As a result, a blacklisted user (e.g., `alice`) can call `setMintCap` to modify the minting cap, potentially leading to unauthorized control over the protocol’s token supply.

```solidity
function setMintCap(uint256 newMintCap) external {
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(MINT_CAP_OPERATOR);
        if (newMintCap == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }
        if (newMintCap == $.mintCap) {
            revert SameValue();
        }
        if (newMintCap < totalSupply()) {
            revert MintCapTooSmall();
        }
        $.mintCap = newMintCap;
        emit MintCapUpdated(newMintCap);
    }
```
=> As you can see, there is no check to validate if the caller is a blacklisted user


### Internal Pre-conditions

Nil

### External Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to have blacklisted a malicious user who has a Mint Cap Operator Role

### Attack Path

1. At first, a malicious user or an attacker, who has been been granted a `MINT_CAP_OPERATOR` role for example,  through a legitimate means or through a prior exploit, is blacklisted by the protocol as a result of his malicious activities.
2. However, though he has been blacklisted, the attacker can still calls the `setMintCap` with a very high value (e.g., `1e30`), or even a very low value(griefing), hence bypassing the blacklist check.
3. Meanwhile, if the attacker also has minting access/priviledges (or exploits another vulnerability), he can mint excessive tokens, which can inflate the supply and potentially leads to the draining of protocol funds or better still manipulating markets.
4. Even without minting privileges, setting an incorrect minting cap could disrupt protocol operations or governance.

### Impact

A `blacklisted` user can set the minting cap to a very/arbitrarily high value, which can allow an `excessive minting of tokens` (if paired with minting permissions) or can lead to the disruption of protocol economics. Also, being able to modify the minting cap can lead to `inflation of the token supply`, devaluing the token and affecting stakeholders.

### PoC

Copy and paste the following test into Eth0.t.sol file, no extra configaration is needed. 

```solidity
function testSetMintCapByBlacklistedUser() external {
    // Grant mint cap operator role to alice initially
    vm.prank(admin);
    eth0Token.grantRole(keccak256("MINT_CAP_OPERATOR"), alice);
    //On the long run, alice account got compromised and was blacklisted
    //due to malicious activities
    
    // Blacklist alice
    vm.prank(blacklistOperator);
    eth0Token.blacklist(alice);
    //alice is confirmed blacklisted
    assertTrue(eth0Token.isBlacklisted(alice), "Alice should be blacklisted");
    //alice (already been compromised) is still able to perform
    //major activities on the protocol
    // Alice (already blacklisted) attempt to set mint cap
    uint256 newCap = 1000e18;
    vm.prank(alice);
    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true, address(eth0Token));
    emit MintCapUpdated(newCap);
    eth0Token.setMintCap(newCap);
    
    // Verify mint cap was updated
    assertEq(eth0Token.getMintCap(), newCap, "Mint cap should be updated");
}
```
**Result**: The test passes, confirming that a blacklisted user can update the minting cap.


### Mitigation

1. **Add Blacklist Check in `setMintCap`**:
   - Modify the `setMintCap` function to check the caller’s blacklist status:
     ```solidity
     function setMintCap(uint256 newCap) external {
         require(!isBlacklisted(msg.sender), "Caller is blacklisted");
         require(hasRole(MINT_CAP_OPERATOR, msg.sender), "Caller is not a mint cap operator");
        ...
     }
     ```

2. **Revoke Roles on Blacklisting**:
   - Automatically revoke all roles from an address when it is blacklisted to prevent lingering permissions:
     ```solidity
     function blacklist(address account) external onlyRole(BLACKLIST_OPERATOR) {
         _blacklist[account] = true;
         _revokeAllRoles(account); // Implement to revoke all roles
         emit Blacklisted(account);
     }
     ```
   - This ensures blacklisted users cannot retain privileged roles.
