# There could be a slight drop in the price of wstETH, leading to more money for user redeem and ultimately undercollateralization

### Summary

The collateral for the protocol is wstETH, and its price may be slightly reduced due to the following:
Slashing/Penalties: If Lido's validator is penalized by the Ethereum protocol for misconduct, this will result in a decrease in the total amount of ETH in the Lido staking pool.
This is possible, but rare.

When redeeming, the calculation of how much Collateral a user can get is calculated based on the price of wstETH. If it happens that the wstETH price is lowered, and there is a large amount of redemption made by the user/attacker at this time. Due to the low price of wstETH, the same eth0 will give more wstETH to users, making the collateral of wstETH in the protocol insufficient. Even if the wstETH price recovers in the end, it will not be able to make up for it, and the protocol will remain undercollateralized for a long time, affecting the entire protocol.

### Root Cause

In the [latestRoundData](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L86) function, there may be a brief drop in wstETH, which the protocol does not consider.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

If Lido's validator is penalized by the Ethereum protocol for misconduct

### Attack Path

1. The user/attacker swaps
2. Lido's validator is penalized, causing a brief drop in the wstETH price
3. The user/attacker withdraws the funds and gets more wstETH at this time. This can lead to under-collateralization of the protocol.

### Impact

There may be a slight drop in the wstETH price, resulting in users redeeming more funds, which ultimately leads to under-collateralization
