# Access Control Bypass in `activateCBR` Allows Admin to Pause Swaps, Violating Pauser Role Separation

### Summary

The protocol uses a **role-based access control** model where different roles (e.g., admin, pauser) manage different responsibilities. The `pauseSwap()` function is explicitly protected by `_requireOnlyPauser()`, meaning only a designated pauser can pause swap functionality.

However, the `activateCBR()` function, which is restricted to the admin role, also pauses swap functionality by directly setting the internal flag `$_swapPaused = true`, bypassing the intended access control mechanism for swap pausing.

This breaks the logical separation of duties between roles, introduces governance ambiguity, and may unintentionally grant broader powers to the admin than what the role model intends.

### Root Cause

In `DaoCollateral.sol` contract, admin can also pause swap, which is the root cause of this violation of RBAC model.

```solidity
$_swapPaused = true
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

1. **Access control violation:** Admin can perform actions (pausing swap) outside their defined role.
2. **Inconsistency in logic:** Bypasses `whenSwapNotPaused` and `_requireOnlyPauser()` checks that would normally protect swap state.
3. The `activateCBR()` function pauses swaps directly by setting `$_swapPaused = true`, but bypasses the expected access control check _requireOnlyPauser(). This violates the access control design where only addresses with the Pauser role should control swap pausing via the `pauseSwap()` function. **If the pauser role is delegated to a separate entity (e.g., a multisig or guardian), this creates a centralization and governance risk**

### PoC

**PoC:-**

```solidity
function test_PoCAccesControlViolation() public {
        //try pausing swaps directly with function
        vm.prank(admin);
        vm.expectRevert();
        daoCollateral.pauseSwap();
        //admin can't pause directly, but through this function, admin can pause and violates the role based access controls
        vm.prank(admin);
        daoCollateral.activateCBR(1e18);

        //check if already paused
        vm.prank(pauser);
        vm.expectRevert();
        daoCollateral.pauseSwap();
    }
```

**Test Results:-**

```solidity

    │   └─ ← [Return]

    │   └─ ← [Revert] SwapMustNotBePaused()
```
```solidity
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed;
```


### Mitigation

Remove the part:-

```solidity
$_swapPaused = true
```
and make pauser call `pauseSwap` function separately after activating **CBR** mechanism.
