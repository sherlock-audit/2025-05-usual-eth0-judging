# Stale Contract Addresses Due to Lack of Update Propagation Mechanism

### Summary

The `RegistryContract` allows updating contract addresses via `RegistryContract::setContract` function without checking if the contract name already has a contract address it is pointing at , but dependent contracts in the system cache these addresses only once during initialization. There is no mechanism to propagate updates to dependent contracts. When a contract address is updated in the registry

### Root Cause

In RegistryContract.sol::L72-L90, there is no check to determine if a contract address has already been registered, which allows for contract updates. However, dependent functions such as those in DaoCollateral.sol only store the current address that is returned, and there is no function in these contracts to update the stored address if the contracts are updated in RegistryContract.sol

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The Oracle contract was updated in the `RegistryContract.sol` due to an vulnerability 
2. The CollateralDao contracts or any other contract that depends on this Oracle contract would still be pointing to the old contract address because they don't get updated immediately when there is change in the `RegistryContract::setContract` function  

### External Pre-conditions

 Update a contract address in the `RegistryContract.sol` after initializing the depending contracts 

### Attack Path

1. The admin use the `RegistryContract::setContract` function to update the Oracle contract address due to an issue in price reporting 
2. An attacker see that the `DaoCollateral.sol` price still point to the old contract address, the attacker can exploit this by getting more than they should because of this update  

### Impact

1. Critical system breakage: Contracts using stale addresses may interact with deprecated or non-existent contracts, causing core functionality to fail

2. Funds at risk: If stale addresses point to malicious contracts (e.g., after a compromise), user funds could be stolen



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There are two ways to mitigate this issue 
1. Revert setting contract address for contract name that have already been set 
```diff
    function setContract(bytes32 name, address contractAddress) external {
        // if address is null reverts
        if (contractAddress == address(0)) {
            revert NullAddress();
        }
        // if name is null reverts
        if (name == bytes32(0)) {
            revert InvalidName();
        }
  

        RegistryContractStorageV0 storage $ = _registryContractStorageV0();
        // only admin can set the contract
        if (!IRegistryAccess($._registryAccess).hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            revert NotAuthorized();
        }
++     if($._contracts[name] != address(0)){
++         revert ContractAddressAlreadySet();

++       }

        $._contracts[name] = contractAddress;
        emit SetContract(name, contractAddress);
    }
```
2. Create a function that allows depending contract to update state to the latest contract address if the corresponding contract name is set in the `RegistryContract.sol`
