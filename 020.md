# Disabled swap functionality for users

### Summary

The missing unpause in `deactivateCBR()` will cause a permanent swap functionality disable for users as an admin will deactivate CBR without unpausing swaps.

### Root Cause

In src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol the deactivateCBR() function fails to set `_swapPaused`  back to false when deactivating CBR. This is an oversight as the swap functionality remains paused even after the emergency situation (CBR) is resolved.

```solidity 

   function activateCBR(uint256 coefficient) external {
        // we should revert if the coef is greater than 1
        if (coefficient > SCALAR_ONE) {
            revert CBRIsTooHigh();
        } else if (coefficient == 0) {
            revert CBRIsNull();
        }
        _requireOnlyAdmin();
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        $.isCBROn = true;
     @ >    $._swapPaused = true;  //swap paused 
        $.cbrCoef = coefficient;
        emit CBRActivated($.cbrCoef);
        emit SwapPaused();
    }

```


swap not unpaused after deactivating CBR
```solidity 
function deactivateCBR() external {
        _requireOnlyAdmin();
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        if ($.isCBROn == false) revert SameValue();
        $.isCBROn = false;
        emit CBRDeactivated();
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call activateCBR() to set _swapPaused to true
2. isCBROn needs to be true
3. Admin needs to call deactivateCBR() to set isCBROn to false

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls activateCBR() which sets _swapPaused to true and isCBROn to true
2. Admin calls deactivateCBR() which only sets isCBROn to false but leaves _swapPaused as true
3. Users attempt to call swap() or swapWithPermit() but all transactions revert with SwapMustNotBePaused error

### Impact

The users cannot swap their collateral tokens for ETH0 tokens. The protocol's core swap functionality remains  disabled until an address with UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE manually calls unpauseSwap().Making it temporary freeze even after system is in a healthy condition 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following line in the deactivateCBR() function after setting isCBROn to false:
``` solidity 
$._swapPaused = false;
emit SwapUnPaused();
```

This will ensure that swap functionality is restored when CBR is deactivated, allowing users to resume normal operations.
