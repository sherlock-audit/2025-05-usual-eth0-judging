# Oracle feed staleness or manipulation will enable incorrect collateral valuation

### Summary

A missing freshness check on `oracle.getPrice(...)` will cause under- or over-collateralization for ETH0 holders as a stale or manipulated Chainlink feed will return an incorrect price and the protocol will mint or redeem based on bad data.

### Root Cause

In [`DaoCollateral.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L389) (around lines using `_getPriceAndDecimals` → `$.oracle.getPrice(collateralToken)`), the contract fetches the collateral’s ETH price without verifying timestamp or deviation bounds. Because no on-chain check enforces “freshness,” a stale or manipulated price slips through until the off-chain bot pauses, allowing incorrect minting/redeeming in the interim.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The registered `IOracle` contract owner (or publisher) fails to update the feed, so `getPrice(...)` returns an outdated value.
2. No on-chain “max staleness” or deviation guard exists in `DaoCollateral`, so `oracle.getPrice(...)` is used unconditionally.
3. The off-chain Chainlink-monitoring bot has not yet triggered `pauseSwap()`/`pauseRedeem()`.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Chainlink’s stETH/ETH price feed lags (e.g., due to network congestion or node downtime) or an oracle publisher intentionally posts a manipulated price.
2. Market price diverges significantly from the on-chain feed but the on-chain view remains stale.


### Attack Path

1. Price feed becomes stale or is manipulated so that `oracle.getPrice(wstETH)` returns, say, `2 ETH` per wstETH instead of `1 ETH`.
2. A user calls:

   ```solidity
   daoCollateral.swap(address(wstETH), 1e18, 0);
   ```
3. Inside `_swapCheckAndGetETHQuote`, the contract does:

   ```solidity
   (wadPriceInETH, _) = _getPriceAndDecimals(wstETH);
   wadQuoteInETH = Math.mulDiv(1e18, wadPriceInETH, SCALAR_ONE);
   ```

   which computes `wadQuoteInETH = 2e18`.
4. The user deposits 1 wstETH, the treasury receives 1 wstETH, but DaoCollateral mints **2 ETH0**.
5. Immediately (before the off-chain bot pauses), the user calls:

   ```solidity
   daoCollateral.redeem(address(wstETH), 2e18, 0);
   ```
6. The stale price may still be used (if the bot hasn’t paused yet) or the CBR implant may cut refunds unevenly—but in any case, the treasury only holds 1 wstETH, so backing < supply.
7. The protocol becomes under-collateralized by 1 ETH0, breaking the 1:1 peg.


### Impact

The protocol’s **1:1 peg invariant** is violated. ETH0 holders suffer a loss of trust and value—because ETH0 supply exceeds real ETH backing by up to the manipulated amount. An attacker can mint “free” ETH0 on stale data and redeem for real ETH once the feed updates. The protocol may also block legitimate swaps/redeems while the feed is stale, leading to user funds getting stuck.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **On-chain Freshness Check**

   * Extend `IOracle.getPrice(...)` to return both `(uint256 price, uint256 updatedAt)`. In `_getPriceAndDecimals`, do:

     ```solidity
     (wadPriceInETH, updatedAt) = oracle.getPriceWithTimestamp(collateralToken);
     require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= MAX_STALENESS, "Price stale");
     ```
2. **Deviation Limit**

   * Keep a rolling TWAP or a short-term historical reference. Before minting/redeeming, check:

     ```solidity
     require(
       abs(onChainPrice - twapPrice) <= MAX_DELTA, 
       "Price out of bounds"
     );
     ```
3. **Auto-pause on Invalid Price**

   * If `getPrice(...)` returns zero or fails the above checks, immediately call `pauseSwap()` and/or `pauseRedeem()` to prevent further action until a manual review.
