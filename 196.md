# Redemption opens a path for arbitrage

### Summary

The redeem function is used to redeem user's collateral token.

### Root Cause

The problem is the [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L542) function allows the user to choose their collateral of choice thus leaving a path for users to choose their preferred collateral to redeem. 

```sol
File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
542: @>  function redeem(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)
543:         external 
544:         nonReentrant
545:         whenRedeemNotPaused
546:         whenNotPaused
547:     {

```

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

Assume 2 collaterals, Coll A and Coll B
-  Coll A and Coll B and have been used for swaps
- Coll A drops in price and Bob has initially used Coll A for swap
- price of Coll A drops and Bob redeems choosing Coll B before admin rushes to turn on CBR

### Impact

This can lead to loss for users as there will be less value backing the remaing ETH0 thus making the cbr coeficient smaller hence socialising more loss for users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a mechanism to ensure user's can only redeem the collateral they used for swap
