# setRoleAdmin Allows Instant Privilege Escalation Due to Missing Timelock

### setRoleAdmin Allows Instant Privilege Escalation Due to Missing Timelock

**Description:**  
The `RegistryAccess::setRoleAdmin` function allows any holder of the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to immediately change the admin of any role. Unlike the transfer of the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` which enforces a 3-day timelock via `AccessControlDefaultAdminRulesUpgradeable`, this function does not enforce any delay or waiting period.

**Impact:**  
- An admin can instantly escalate privileges by assigning themselves or another account as the admin of any sensitive role.
- This bypasses the intended governance timelock and increases the risk of accidental or malicious privilege escalation.
- Stakeholders have no warning or time to react to critical admin changes, which could lead to protocol takeovers or abuse of sensitive roles.

**Proof of Concept:**  
1. Admin calls `setRoleAdmin(_SENSITIVE_ROLE, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)`.
2. Admin or a colluding account can now instantly grant or revoke the sensitive role, with no delay or oversight.
3. This can be used to take over protocol functions or assets without the 3-day safety window intended for admin transitions.

```solidity
    function setRoleAdmin(bytes32 role, bytes32 adminRole) external {
        if (!hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
            revert NotAuthorized();
        }
     // not 3-day timelock check here
     @>   _setRoleAdmin(role, adminRole);
    }
```


**Recommended Mitigation:**  
Implement a timelock or governance process for `setRoleAdmin`, similar to the one used for `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` transfers. Alternatively, restrict `setRoleAdmin` to only be callable during contract initialization or by a dedicated governance contract with its own delay mechanism.
