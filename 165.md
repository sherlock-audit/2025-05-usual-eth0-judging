# Blacklist Front-Running

### Summary

The blacklist function in the Eth0 contract allows an address with the BLACKLIST_ROLE to mark another address as blacklisted, preventing it from sending or receiving Eth0 tokens. This introduces a centralization risk where a malicious or compromised role holder could front-run user transactions by blacklisting an address just before a pending transfer is mined, causing the transfer to fail. This "front-running" attack could disrupt user activities, manipulate market conditions, or serve as a griefing mechanism, though it does not directly result in fund theft. The absence of safeguards like transaction ordering protections or decentralized governance mechanisms increases the potential for abuse.

### Root Cause

The blacklist function permits the BLACKLIST_ROLE holder to unilaterally add an address to the blacklist with immediate effect.The lack of restrictions on when or how blacklisting can occur enables a malicious role holder to exploit transaction ordering in the Ethereum mempool, front-running user transfers to cause them to fail.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Blacklist Role Assignment: The attacker must hold the BLACKLIST_ROLE, enforced via registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(BLACKLIST_ROLE).
Target Address Not Blacklisted: The target address must not already be blacklisted, as checked by if ($.isBlacklisted[account]) { revert SameValue(); } 
Pending User Transaction: A user must have a pending transfer transaction in the mempool that the attacker can front-run.

### External Pre-conditions

Mempool Visibility: The attacker must be able to observe pending transactions in the Ethereum mempool.
Gas Price Manipulation: The attacker must be able to submit the blacklist transaction with a higher gas price than the user’s transfer to ensure it is mined first.

### Attack Path

A user submits a transfer transaction to the Ethereum mempool.
The attacker, holding the BLACKLIST_ROLE, observes the pending transfer.
The attacker submits a blacklist transaction targeting the sender or receiver of the transfer, using a higher gas price.
The blacklist transaction is mined first, adding the target address to the blacklist.
When the user’s transfer is mined, the _update function checks the blacklist and reverts with Blacklisted(), causing the transfer to fail.

### Impact

Denial of Service: By front-running a user’s transfer with a blacklist transaction, the attacker can cause the transfer to revert, disrupting the user’s intended action.
Market Manipulation: In a trading context, this could be used to prevent specific transactions from completing, potentially influencing token prices or liquidity.
Griefing: The attacker could target specific users or contracts, causing operational disruptions without direct financial gain.

### Mitigation

Transaction Ordering Protections: Implement mechanisms to prevent front-running, such as commit-reveal schemes or time-based locks.
