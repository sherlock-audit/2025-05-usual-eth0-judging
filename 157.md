# Users stake wstETH but lose the yield of lido

### Summary

eth0 always uses the price of wstETH for swap/redeem.For example, when a user swaps, 1wstETH=1ETH.After a period of time, due to the income of wstETH, 1wstETH=1.1ETH.
If wstETH is not staked to eth0 during this period of time.Users have a profit of 0.1ETH.However, after this period of time has passed, users can still only get wstETH worth 1ETH when they redeem.
The agreement did realize the over-mortgage, but the user lost lido revenue.This is not conducive to the issuance of eth0.Due to the loss, users have no incentive to swap eth0.

### Root Cause

In the [_getQuoteInTokenFromETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L418-L420) function, the protocol will always only calculate how much wstETH a user can get at the current wstETH price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user swaps
2. After some time, the price of wstETH has grown, and users should have received lido yields.
3. The user redeems, but loses Lido's income.

### Impact

Users lose their earnings in wstETH.
