# “Soft-removing” a collateral by zeroing its oracle feed bricks every swap / redeem

### Summary

Governance is supposed to “remove” a collateral token by pointing its oracle to a feed that returns 0 or by letting the feed go stale. According to README
But ClassicalOracle.`_latestRoundData` reverts whenever `answer ≤ 0` or the data are stale.
Every swap, redeem, and mint path loops through all collateral tokens, calling `oracle.getPrice();` if just one token’s oracle now reverts, the entire transaction reverts.
Thus the recommended soft-removal procedure turns into a permanent denial-of-service

### Root Cause

```solidity
(, int256 answer,, uint256 updatedAt,) = priceAggregatorProxy.latestRoundData();
if (answer <= 0 || block.timestamp > updatedAt + timeout) {
    revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
}
```
Any invalid or zero price bubbles up as a revert.
Down-stream, Eth0.mint / DaoCollateral._swapCheckAndGetETHQuote aggregate:

```solidity
for (...) {
    uint256 price = oracle.getPrice(collateral); // <- reverts for the retired token
}

```
With no removal mechanism the bad token remains in getAllEth0CollateralTokens(), so every price loop now reverts.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The retired collateral address is still in `TokenMapping.ETH0CollateralTokens.`

Its oracle feed returns 0 or is stale beyond timeout.

Also important to note that there is no other way to soft remove pricefeed as setting to another token is disastrous and also feed cannot allow to return a non zero price as that will allow deposit at wrong price

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Collateral token X is soft-removed by pointing its feed to zero.

Any user calls swap, redeem, or mint.

Loop hits token X → getPrice(X) reverts → full transaction reverts.

All ETH0 market functions are effectively frozen, producing a protocol-wide DOS.

### Impact

protocol wide DOS

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a DAO-only function that deletes the address and shrinks the active list.
