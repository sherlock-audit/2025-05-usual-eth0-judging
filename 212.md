# Validator slashing will reduce collateralization level of ETH0

### Summary

Lido is staking protocol which incetivise users to stake ETH that will be used futher for staking activity.
While wstETH corresponds to 1e18 shares within stETH contract, it's ETH value depends on amount of staked ETH in lido pool and total shares within the system. 
wstETH = 1e18(shares) * ETH staked / total shares. 

It's important to note: ETH staked is a subject of changes. It is depend on current staking activity and validators slashing and reward distribution.



Lido's validator slashing leads to decreasing of eth value per share 

Same rebasing happens while lido's operator got slashed.

For now when it's clear both depositing rewards and slashing decreasing/increasing staked ETH, but not affecting user's shares we already see a problem which might occur with usage wstETH as collateral token for ETH0.

ETH0 amount to mint/burn calculated based on price fetched via Lido oracle:
LidoWstEthOracle.sol
```solidity
    function latestRoundData()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        )
    {
        // Return mock data for all fields except answer
        roundId = 1;
        answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
        startedAt = block.timestamp;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        answeredInRound = 1;
    }
```
The function fetches eth value of 1e18 shares within stETH token (the data includes rebasing after rewards and slashing). 
As it expected to accrue collateralization level of ETH0 via Lido staking reward (more staking rewards distributed -> more wstETH price is, as it correspond to fixed amount of shares) the slashing event will force to give away more wstETH than it was before slashing. Hence, accrued by the protocol value from rewards will be lost in order return collateral to user for current market price.  

CBR in that point will indeed helps, meanwhile in a system with multiple collateral (as it expected to be added in a future) it will be ineffective as it applied to any tokens, and will prevent another assets to be withdrawn. 



### Root Cause
Protocol can't hold ETH value >= ETH0 minted over time

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

Lido's validators get slashed

### Attack Path

1. User staked 10 wstETH for 11 ETH0 -> 10wseth in the pool at 1.1 price
2. Lido's validators gets slashed -> price decreased to 1:1. Now Usual should give away 11 wstETH, while in pool remains 10.

### Impact

Collateralization drain
