# `cbrCoef` is applied on DAO members in `redeemDao()`

### Summary

DAO members are trusted, but `cbrCoef` is applied on them in `redeemDao()`, causing them to get less collateral.

### Root Cause

[`redeemDao()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L579) calls `_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral`, which calls `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH()`.

[`_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L438) reduces the amount users will receive based on `cbrCoef`.

But DAO role holders are trusted, so the collateral reduction should be excluded if the user has the DAO role.

### Internal Pre-conditions

CBR activated.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Not an attack, but the issue can happen as follows:
- CBR is activated.
- A user holding the DAO role calls `redeemDao()`, and will end up getting less collateral than what he should, even though DAO role holders are trusted.

### Impact

DAO members will end up getting less collateral than what they should.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Exclude the reduction of collateral from DAO role holders.
