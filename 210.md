# Users could be denied of swapping wstETH for ETH0

### Summary

Inside the `DaoCollateral` contract, users can deposit their LSTs and in exchange get an ETH-pegged synthetic token - ETH0. They can do this calling the `DaoCollateral::swap` or `DaoCollateral::swapWithPermit`. At the moment only wstETH is accepted as collateral and based on the exchange rate, fetched from the `LidoWstEthOracle`, the ETH0 amount to be minted is computed. The minting is happening inside the `ETH0` contract, but under certain and very rare conditions it can prevent users from swapping collateral tokens for ETH0.

### Root Cause

The following [`if condition`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L162-L164) can cause a DoS, where users are unable to swap collateral tokens for ETH0.

Let's look at an example and assume that the price of ETH is equal to stETH, which is 2600 USD and the price of wstETH is 3120 USD, which means the exchange rate of wstETH/stETH is 1.2.
1. At the exchange rate of 1.2, multiple users have deposited 100 wstETH tokens over some period of time.
2. In the rare case of slashing, the exchange rate of wstETH for stETH drops to 1.199 and Bob decides to swap his collateral for ETH0.
3. Bob comes in and swaps 10 wstETH. Since the exchange rate is now 1.199 and 1 stETH == 1 ETH, he should get minted 11.99 ETH0. However due to the check inside the [`mint(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L162-L164), his transaction will revert. This will happen because - `totalSupply() + amount > wadCollateralBackingInETH` is going to be equal to true. Before his tx, the `_totalSupply` will be 120e18. The `amount` he will get minted is 11.99e18, so the sum is 131.99e18. The issue is that the `wadCollateralBackingInETH` is calculated as `collateralTokenPriceInETH * IERC20(collateralToken).balanceOf(treasury) / 1e18`, which is eq to: `1.199e18 * 110e18 / 1e18` or 131.89e18  at the time Bob makes his transaction (**131.99e18 > 131.89e18**). Now all users will have to wait until the exchange rate goes back up to 1.2 in order to swap wstETH for ETH0

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

In a very rare case, when Slashing occurs, it is possible that the exchange rate of wstETH for stETH could decrease, therefore preventing users from swapping their LST collateral for ETH0 as explained in the example above.

### Attack Path

1. Users call `swap(...)` inside the `DaoCollateral` contract. Let's say 100 wstETH accumulate inside the treasury.
2. Unexpectedly a Slashing event occurs and this causes the exchange rate of wstETH for stETH to decrease. In our example it went from 1.2 to 1.199, which is less than 0.1% of a decrease. This now won't allow swappers to exchange their wstETH for ETH0, since all the calls will revert inside `ETH0::mint` function due to the following [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L162).

### Impact

Users won't be able to buy ETH0 from the `DaoCollateral` contract until the exchange rate goes back to the initial value, resulting in the condition - `totalSupply() + amount > wadCollateralBackingInETH)` being equal to false.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Account for the rare cases when the exchange rate of an LST for ETH can decrease. Another solution is to deposit more LST tokens inside the treasury in order to make sure the condition is equal to false, but in my opinion that defeats the whole purpose of if-branch in the first place
