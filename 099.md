# Unsafe Casting in getPrice Function.

### Summary

In the function getPrice(), there is an unsafe cast from uint256 to uint8 for the decimalsPrice value returned by _latestRoundData. This unchecked cast may cause overflow or incorrect values during the call to tokenAmountToWad(uint8(decimalsPrice)), which normalizes token prices. This issue leads to price miscalculations not only when decimalsPrice is large (e.g., 300) but also for common decimals like 6, indicating the vulnerability affects typical tokens and risks financial impacts in DeFi logic relying on this function.



### Root Cause

In  `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/AbstractOracle.sol#L103-L108` the cast uint8(decimalsPrice) truncates any decimalsPrice value larger than 255, which could lead to silently incorrect normalization. Since _latestRoundData returns a uint256 for decimals, it can exceed the bounds of uint8, leading to overflow and wrong price values.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1._latestRoundData(token) returns a decimalsPrice as uint256 that can be larger than 255 or any value that breaks normalization.

2.tokenAmountToWad expects tokenDecimals as uint8.

### External Pre-conditions

1.Malicious or faulty oracle feeds incorrect decimalsPrice values.
2.No input validation or bounds enforcement on the returned decimals value.

### Attack Path

1.Oracle returns decimalsPrice > 255 (e.g., 300) or even normal decimals (e.g., 6) but the cast causes unintended results.
2.The cast to uint8 causes truncation or misinterpretation of decimals.
3.The tokenAmountToWad function normalizes price with incorrect decimals.
4.Price is miscalculated, affecting collateral valuation, liquidations, or trades relying on this price.

### Impact

1.Incorrect price normalization causing mispricing even for common decimals tokens.
2.Financial losses due to incorrect collateral valuation.
3.Systemic risk as price feeds are critical to DeFi security.

### Mitigation

Add bounds check before casting.
