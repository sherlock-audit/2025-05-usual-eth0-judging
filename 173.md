# Blacklisted Addresses Can Steal Tokens from Users via `transferFrom`

### Summary

The `Eth0` token contract contains a critical security flaw that allows blacklisted addresses to bypass blacklist restrictions and steal tokens using the `transferFrom` function. This vulnerability arises from how `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `_update` interact. The `approve` function does not enforce any blacklist checks, meaning users can unknowingly grant spending allowances to addresses that are already blacklisted or may become blacklisted later. While both `transfer` and `transferFrom` call the `_update` function to enforce blacklist rules, `_update` only checks the `from` and `to` addresses—ignoring `msg.sender`, who is the actual caller in a `transferFrom` transaction. As a result, a blacklisted spender can exploit a previously granted allowance to call `transferFrom` and drain tokens from a legitimate user, completely bypassing blacklist enforcement and enabling unauthorized transfers.

### Root Cause

**Core Issue:** The vulnerability arises from incomplete blacklist validation in the `_update` function. While it checks the `from` and `to` addresses, it fails to validate `msg.sender`—the actual transaction executor in `transferFrom` scenarios. As a result, a blacklisted address that was previously approved by a user can still invoke `transferFrom` to transfer the user’s tokens. This allows blacklisted users to bypass restrictions and move funds from legitimate users, despite being explicitly blocked by the blacklist mechanism.

}

### Blacklist Bypass in Token Operations: A Deeper Look at `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `_update`

In analyzing the behavior of token transfer mechanisms, particularly about blacklist enforcement, three key functions are involved: `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `_update`. Each plays a distinct role in the process, and the way they interact can unintentionally introduce security bypasses. Below is a breakdown of their behaviors and the underlying issues.

1. `approve` Does Not Enforce Blacklist Checks

The `approve` function is responsible for setting spending allowances between users. However, it does **not** perform any blacklist checks:

- It directly updates the `allowance` mapping.
- No validation is performed to determine whether the `msg.sender` or the spender is blacklisted.
- And approvals made **before** a user is blacklisted remain valid **after** the user is blacklisted.

This creates a gap where blacklisted users can still indirectly transfer tokens via prior approvals.

2. `transfer` vs `transferFrom`: Different Behaviors, Same `_update`

Both `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions eventually call `_update`, which enforces blacklist checks on the sender and recipient addresses (`from` and `to`). However, the difference lies in **who** triggers the transaction:

- **`transfer`**:

  - `from == msg.sender`
  - Blacklist checks are effective, as the initiating user is the token owner.
  - If the sender is blacklisted, the transfer is blocked.

- **`transferFrom`**:

  - `from ≠ msg.sender`
  - The actual initiator (`msg.sender`) is typically a third party who was previously approved to spend on behalf of `from`.
  - If the `from` address is blacklisted, it is detected—but the initiating `msg.sender` is **not** checked.
  - This allows a blacklisted user to bypass blacklist restrictions and transfer funds that were previously approved to them by legitimate users.

3. `_update` Performs Incomplete Blacklist Checks

The `_update` function, which is ultimately responsible for enforcing blacklist restrictions, only checks the `from` and `to` addresses:

- It does **not** check `msg.sender`, the actual transaction initiator.
- In a `transferFrom` scenario, where `msg.sender ≠ from`, this creates a blind spot.
- A blacklisted user who was previously approved by a legitimate token holder can still use `transferFrom` to move the holder’s tokens—completely bypassing blacklist enforcement despite being explicitly blocked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `Eth0` contract must have the blacklist functionality active.
2. A malicious user can be blacklisted via the `blacklist` function.
3. The `_update` function must be implemented with the current incomplete validation logic.
4. The contract must allow `transferFrom` operations (standard ERC20 functionality).

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Pre-existing Approval**: A legitimate user approved an address that was either already blacklisted or later added to the blacklist.
2. **Timing Window**: The approval must still be valid (not revoked) when the blacklisted user attempts the attack.
3. **Available Balance**: The account from which tokens are transferred (from) must hold enough tokens, even though an approved spender initiates the transfer.
4. **Network Conditions**: Standard Ethereum transaction execution conditions.

### Attack Path

### Scenario 1: Time-based Attack (Most Realistic)
1. Alice (legitimate user) approves Bob for 1000 ETH0 tokens
   ```solidity
   // Alice calls: approve(bob, 1000e18)
   ```

2. Bob gets blacklisted due to malicious activity
   ```solidity
   // Admin calls: blacklist(bob)
   ```

3. Bob exploits the vulnerability
   ```solidity
   // Bob calls: transferFrom(alice, carol, 1000e18)
   // Succeeds because _update only checks Alice and Carol, not Bob
   ```

### Scenario 2: Information Asymmetry Attack
1. Bob is already blacklisted but Alice is unaware
2. Bob uses social engineering or deceptive interfaces to obtain approval
3. Bob immediately executes `transferFrom` to move Alice's tokens

### Impact

### High Severity Impact:
- **Complete Blacklist Bypass**: Blacklisted users can continue to move tokens freely
- **Fund Theft**: Malicious actors can drain approved balances from legitimate users
- **Regulatory Compliance Failure**: Undermines the entire purpose of the blacklist mechanism

### Affected Functions:
- `transferFrom()` - Primary attack vector
- Any contract that calls `transferFrom` on behalf of users
- Integration with DeFi protocols that rely on approvals

### PoC

This Proof of Concept highlights a critical flaw in the blacklist enforcement logic of the `Eth0` token contract. Although the contract correctly blocks direct transfers from blacklisted addresses, it fails to prevent `transferFrom` calls initiated by blacklisted users who have been granted allowances.

In this PoC, Bob is blacklisted and correctly blocked from transferring tokens directly. However, he is still able to call `transferFrom(alice, carol, amount)`—leveraging a prior approval from Alice—and successfully transfers tokens, bypassing the blacklist restriction entirely.

To validate the blacklist enforcement logic, we added the following two tests to the `test/token/Eth0.t.sol` file:

- `testBlacklistBypassViaTransferFrom`: Demonstrates that a blacklisted address (e.g., Bob) can still exploit the `transferFrom` function to move tokens using allowances granted by other users (e.g., Alice → Carol).
- `testBlacklistDirectTransferCorrectlyBlocked`: Verifies that a blacklisted address (e.g., Bob) is correctly prevented from performing a direct token transfer.

These tests were executed using the following command:

```bash
forge test --match-path test/token/Eth0.t.sol --match-test 'testBlacklist(BypassViaTransferFrom|DirectTransferCorrectlyBlocked)'
```

Both tests passed successfully, confirming the existence of the bypass and the correctness of the blacklist restriction in direct transfers. The output was:

```bash
Ran 2 tests for test/token/Eth0.t.sol:Eth0Test
[PASS] testBlacklistBypassViaTransferFrom() (gas: 263114)
[PASS] testBlacklistDirectTransferCorrectlyBlocked() (gas: 190792)
Suite result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 15.53s (4.19ms CPU time)
```

This confirms that the current implementation fails to enforce blacklist restrictions consistently, leaving the `transferFrom` path vulnerable.

```solidity

  function testBlacklistBypassViaTransferFrom() public {
    // Setup: Mint tokens to Alice and establish approval relationship
    allowlistAliceAndMintTokens(); // Alice receives 2e18 tokens

    // Alice approves Bob
    vm.prank(alice);
    eth0Token.approve(bob, 1000e18);

    // Verify initial state
    assertEq(eth0Token.balanceOf(alice), 2e18);
    assertEq(eth0Token.allowance(alice, bob), 1000e18);
    assertFalse(eth0Token.isBlacklisted(bob));

    // Admin blacklists Bob
    vm.prank(blacklistOperator);
    eth0Token.blacklist(bob);
    assertTrue(eth0Token.isBlacklisted(bob));

    // Key test: Blacklisted user Bob can still use transferFrom
    vm.prank(bob);
    eth0Token.transferFrom(alice, carol, 1e18); // This should fail but succeeds!

    // Verify attack success
    assertEq(eth0Token.balanceOf(alice), 1e18); // Alice lost 1e18
    assertEq(eth0Token.balanceOf(carol), 1e18); // Carol received 1e18
    assertEq(eth0Token.allowance(alice, bob), 999e18); // Allowance decreased correctly

    // This proves the blacklist restriction was bypassed
  }

  function testBlacklistDirectTransferCorrectlyBlocked() public {
    // Setup: Mint some tokens to Bob
    vm.prank(address(registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_DAO_COLLATERAL)));
    eth0Token.mint(bob, 100e18);

    // Add Bob to blacklist
    vm.prank(blacklistOperator);
    eth0Token.blacklist(bob);

    // Verify direct transfer is correctly blocked
    vm.prank(bob);
    vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(Blacklisted.selector));
    eth0Token.transfer(carol, 50e18); // Correctly fails
  }

```

### Mitigation

To prevent blacklisted addresses from bypassing restrictions and executing unauthorized token transfers, two key modifications are recommended:

1. **Strengthen blacklist checks in the `_update` function** to ensure that not only the `from` and `to` addresses, but also the actual caller (`msg.sender`), are validated against the blacklist. This closes the loophole exploited in `transferFrom` calls where a blacklisted spender acts on a legitimate user’s behalf.

2. **Introduce blacklist validation in the approval process** by updating the `_approve` function to reject any attempts to create allowances involving blacklisted addresses—whether they are the owner or the spender. This ensures that malicious actors cannot receive or retain approvals once blacklisted.

Together, these changes provide comprehensive enforcement of blacklist policies across both transfer and approval flows.

### Primary Fix: Enhanced _update Function

```solidity
    function _update(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable) {
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        
        // Check from and to addresses
-       if ($.isBlacklisted[from]) || $.isBlacklisted[to])) {
+       if ($.isBlacklisted[from]) || $.isBlacklisted[to] || $.isBlacklisted[msg.sender]) {
            revert Blacklisted();
        }  
        super._update(from, to, amount);
    }
```

### Secondary Fix: Enhanced Approval Function

```solidity
    function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value) internal virtual override {
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
    
+       // Prevent approvals involving blacklisted addresses
+       if ($.isBlacklisted[owner] || $.isBlacklisted[spender]) {
+           revert Blacklisted();
+       }
        
        super._approve(owner, spender, value);
    }
```
