# Malicious user can DOS minting by flashloaning or borrowingto mint all tokens

## Summary
When swapping a user can pass their collateral asset to swap collateral for minted tokens, However when swapping minted tokens have a supply cap so when the supply reaches cap minting becomes DOS'ed , So user with a large collateral can decides to borrow and swap all asset till if fills supply cap preventing other users from minting 
## Description
```solidity
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(ETH0_MINT);
        IOracle oracle = IOracle($.registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_ORACLE));
        address treasury = $.registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_TREASURY);

        // Check if minting would exceed the mint cap
@>        if (totalSupply() + amount > $.mintCap) {
            revert AmountExceedCap();
        }

```
As we can see the supply cap is checked for protocol before minting however when swapping tokens to mint Eth0 it does not regulate the Cap for each user allowing a single whale user to mint whole or large amount of Eth0.
## Impact
DOS of minting tokens for other users 

## Recommended Mitigation
Regulate the amount msg.sender can mint like a limit for one user
