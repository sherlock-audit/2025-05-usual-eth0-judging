# LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed incorrectly returns wstETH/stETH price instead of wstETH/ETH price

## Summary

The `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed` contract claims to provide the wstETH/ETH price but actually returns the wstETH/stETH conversion rate.
This leads to a significant pricing discrepancy, as stETH does not maintain a perfect 1:1 peg with ETH and typically trades around 0.9996 ETH per stETH. As can be seen here: https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Curve-ETHstETH

## Vulnerability Detail

The faulty oracle is deployed as the primary wstETH price source in `ClassicalOracle` via the Mainnet deployment script, affecting all protocol operations.

If stETH trades at 0.9996 ETH:

* Actual wstETH/ETH price: `1.1234 * 0.9996 = 1.1229 ETH`
* Oracle-reported price: `1.1234` (stETH, treated as ETH)
* **Error**: \~0.045% overvaluation per transaction

The contract's `description()` function returns `wstETH / ETH`, but the implementation actually returns the wstETH/stETH rate.

Both `getRoundData()` and `latestRoundData()` functions return:

```solidity
   answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
```

This returns the wstETH → stETH rate, not the wstETH → ETH price.

The Usual states that implementation follows `Aave’s precedent`, but it does not account for conditions where stETH cannot be redeemed for ETH immediately due to the standard 5-day withdrawal delay, or extreme scenarios such as Lido entering "Bunker Mode," which could cause a stETH to ETH depeg.

## Impact

* wstETH is consistently overvalued in protocols that expect ETH-denominated pricing.
* The pricing error introduces exploitable arbitrage opportunities, especially when new LSTs are added.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Combine the `wstETH.stEthPerToken()` rate with a reliable Chainlink stETH/ETH price feed to compute the correct wstETH/ETH price.
