# Privilege Escalation via Role Misconfiguration

### Summary

The RegistryAccess contract, responsible for managing role-based access control in the Usual ETH0 protocol, introduces a significant centralization risk through its role management mechanisms. Specifically, the setRoleAdmin function allows the holder of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to reassign the admin role for any other role, and the beginDefaultAdminTransfer function (inherited from OpenZeppelin's AccessControlDefaultAdminRulesUpgradeable) permits transferring the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE itself after a 3-day delay. A malicious or compromised admin could exploit these functions to escalate privileges, granting unauthorized access to critical roles such as ETH0_MINT or DAO_REDEMPTION_ROLE, potentially leading to over-minting of Eth0 tokens, unauthorized redemptions, or other protocol disruptions. The absence of additional governance safeguards, such as multi-signature requirements or longer timelocks, exacerbates this vulnerability.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in two functions within RegistryAccess.sol.

function setRoleAdmin(bytes32 role, bytes32 adminRole) external {
    if (!hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) {
        revert NotAuthorized();
    }
    _setRoleAdmin(role, adminRole);
}

This function allows the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder to assign any role to be managed by another role, creating opportunities for privilege escalation if the secondary role is compromised.

__AccessControlDefaultAdminRules_init_unchained(3 days, deployer);

The beginDefaultAdminTransfer function allows the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder to initiate a transfer of their role to another address, which can be accepted after 3 days. While the delay provides some mitigation, a compromised admin could still transfer control to an attacker

### Internal Pre-conditions

setRoleAdmin Path:
Admin Role: The attacker must hold the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (enforced by hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)).
Target Role Relevance: The target role must be a valid role used within the protocol for access control.
Secondary Role Assignment: The secondary role must be assigned to the attacker, allowing them to use it to grant the target role after reassignment.

beginDefaultAdminTransfer Path:
Admin Role: The attacker must hold the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.
No Pending Transfer: There must not be an ongoing admin transfer request in the contractâ€™s state (enforced by AccessControlDefaultAdminRulesUpgradeable).

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Privilege Escalation via setRoleAdmin

The attacker gains control of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE through a compromised admin account or role assignment flaw in the registryAccess system.The attacker calls setRoleAdmin to reassign the admin role of ETH0_MINT to a less secure role they control.The attacker uses the less secure role to grant ETH0_MINT to themselves, enabling unauthorized minting of Eth0 tokens in the Eth0 contract.The attacker mints excessive Eth0 tokens, redeeming them for collateral assets like wstETH via DaoCollateral.redeem, draining protocol reserves.

Privilege Escalation via Admin Transfer

The attacker gains control of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE as above.The attacker calls beginDefaultAdminTransfer to initiate a transfer of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to their address, starting a 3-day delay.After 3 days, the attacker accepts the transfer, gaining full admin control (AccessControlDefaultAdminRulesUpgradeable inherited functionality).The attacker assigns critical roles to themselves, enabling unauthorized actions like over-minting or fee manipulation across the protocol.

### Impact

Privilege Escalation via setRoleAdmin: By reassigning the admin of a critical role like ETH0_MINT to a less secure role, an attacker could grant themselves or a compromised account the ability to mint unlimited Eth0 tokens, inflating the supply and potentially draining collateral reserves.

Privilege Escalation via Admin Transfer: Transferring the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to an attacker after a 3-day delay grants full control over all roles, enabling the attacker to manipulate any aspect of the protocol, such as setting fees, pausing operations, or assigning roles to malicious entities.

Financial Loss: Unauthorized minting or redemptions could lead to significant losses, exceeding 1% of protocol funds (Sherlock high-severity threshold), as collateral assets like wstETH are drained.

Reputational Damage: Loss of user trust due to perceived centralization risks and potential exploitation could reduce protocol adoption and liquidity.

}

### Mitigation

Extend Timelock Duration: Increase the admin transfer delay to 7 days or more, providing additional time for governance intervention.
