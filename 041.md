# Hard-Coded `MAX_COLLATERAL_TOKEN_COUNT` Blocks Future Collateral Additions

### Summary

`TokenMapping.addEth0CollateralToken` reverts once `_eth0ToCollateralTokenLastId `exceeds the global constant `MAX_COLLATERAL_TOKEN_COUNT`, currently fixed at 10. Because collateral tokens cannot be deleted—only “soft-removed” by altering their price feeds(as atated by protocol in README)— the protocol may permanently run out of slots for new collateral assets, even though some earlier tokens are no longer usable. An admin controlled setter for the cap (or a true removal mechanism) is needed to avoid deadlocking collateral expansion.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/TokenMapping.sol#L97

`MAX_COLLATERAL_TOKEN_COUNT` is an immutable Solidity constant imported from constants.sol.
```solidity

if ($._eth0ToCollateralTokenLastId > MAX_COLLATERAL_TOKEN_COUNT) {
    revert TooManyCollateralTokens();
}
```

Since TokenMapping never decrements _eth0ToCollateralTokenLastId, every call to addEth0CollateralToken consumes one of only ten IDs forever. “Soft-removing” a collateral by changing its oracle price does not free its slot.


### Internal Pre-conditions

`_eth0ToCollateralTokenLastId` == `MAX_COLLATERAL_TOKEN_COUNT`.

### External Pre-conditions

Admin wishes to onboard an additional collateral token after one or more of the originals has become unusable or deprecated(soft removed).

### Attack Path

- Ten collateral tokens are registered over time.

- One token is later considered unsafe; its oracle price is set to zero (soft removal).

- A subsequent call to `addEth0CollateralToken(newToken)` reverts with TooManyCollateralTokens() because `_eth0ToCollateralTokenLastId` is already 10.

- The protocol can no longer accept new collateral without a full contract upgrade.



### Impact

deprecated(soft- removed) tokens prevents replacement with safer assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an admin controlled setter  so the 10-token cap can be raised, preventing the collateral list from dead-locking.
