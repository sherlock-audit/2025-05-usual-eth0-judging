# Swaps are not paused when CBR is active, however, when CBR is inactive swaps remain paused.

## Description
The Counter Bank Run (CBR) mechanism is designed to protect the protocol during periods of high redemption pressure (a "bank run"). When activated, it applies a coefficient to redemptions, giving users less collateral tokens than they would normally receive when redeeming ETH0, and it also pauses the swap functionality.

In the `activateCBR` function, we can see that activating CBR automatically pauses swaps:

```solidity
function activateCBR(uint256 coefficient) external {
    // we should revert if the coef is greater than 1
    if (coefficient > SCALAR_ONE) {
        revert CBRIsTooHigh();
    } else if (coefficient == 0) {
        revert CBRIsNull();
    }
    _requireOnlyAdmin();
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    $.isCBROn = true;
    $._swapPaused = true; // @audit it makes no sense to pause swaps since cbr is only used in swaps
    $.cbrCoef = coefficient;
    emit CBRActivated($.cbrCoef);
    emit SwapPaused();
}
```

The code explicitly sets `$._swapPaused = true`, which prevents users from swapping collateral tokens for ETH0 tokens. An audit comment suggests that "it makes no sense to pause swaps since cbr is only used in swaps," but this is actually incorrect. CBR primarily affects redemptions, not swaps.

Since when CBR is active, it affects:

1. **Reduced Collateral Returns**: Users redeeming ETH0 for collateral tokens receive less collateral than they would normally. This is implemented in the `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` function:

```solidity
if ($.isCBROn) {
    //@audit this will just give the user less tokens
    amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
}
```

2. **Fee Forfeiture**: When CBR is active, redemption fees are not minted to the yield treasury, effectively burning them to improve the protocol's collateralization ratio:

```solidity
// If the CBR is on, the fees are forfeited from the yield treasury to favor the collateralization ratio
if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn) {
    $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee);
}
```

The issue becomes apparent when examining the `deactivateCBR` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L264

```solidity
function deactivateCBR() external {
    //@audit this should unpause swaps!
    _requireOnlyAdmin();
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    if ($.isCBROn == false) revert SameValue();
    $.isCBROn = false;
    emit CBRDeactivated();
}
```

When CBR is deactivated, the function only sets `$.isCBROn = false`, but it doesn't reset `$._swapPaused` back to `false`. This means that even though the CBR mechanism is turned off, the swap functionality remains paused.

This creates a logical inconsistency in the protocol's behavior: activating CBR automatically pauses swaps, but deactivating CBR doesn't automatically unpause them.

## Proof of Concept
No response

## Mitigation

To fix this issue, the `deactivateCBR` function should be modified to also unpause swaps:

```solidity
function deactivateCBR() external {
    _requireOnlyAdmin();
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    if ($.isCBROn == false) revert SameValue();
    $.isCBROn = false;
    $._swapPaused = false; // Add this line to unpause swaps
    emit CBRDeactivated();
    emit SwapUnPaused(); // Add this event emission
}
```

This would ensure that when CBR is deactivated, the swap functionality is automatically unpaused, maintaining consistency in the protocol's state management.
