# ETH0 Redemption Fee Minting Mechanism Causes Systemic Depeg Risk

### Summary

The design choice to mint redeem fee directly in _calculateFee will cause de-pegging risk for ETH0 holders as the protocol will inflate ETH0 supply without backing collateral, resulting in a systemic collateral deficit over time.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L484-L485
The choice to mint fee tokens (stableFee) to the treasury instead of deducting them from the user's redeemed amount is a mistake as it increases the total ETH0 supply without any collateral backing, undermining the 1:1 peg and collateral integrity.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. DaoCollateralStorageV0.redeemFee must be set to at least 1%.

2. User calls redeem() or similar function with eth0Amount > 0.

3. System allows minting of stableFee to treasury without burning additional ETH0 or locking equivalent collateral.



### External Pre-conditions

1. ETH0 price remains assumed to be pegged at 1:1 to ETH.
2. Collateral oracle (e.g. for wstETH) provides stable price feed and does not reject requests.

### Attack Path

1. User calls redeem(100 ETH0) expecting to receive ~100 ETH worth of collateral.

2. Protocol executes _calculateFee() which computes stableFee = 1 ETH0 and burnedEth0 = 99 ETH0.

3. Protocol burns 100 ETH0 from the user.

4. Protocol mints 1 ETH0 to treasuryYield address.

5. Protocol returns collateral worth only 99 ETH0 to the user (as if 1 ETH0 is the fee).

6. Net result: system mints extra ETH0 without collateral backing it, creating 1 ETH0 of unbacked supply.

7. Repeating this over many redeems, collateralization rate declines, peg breaks.

### Impact

Undermines the 1:1 collateral backing ratio of ETH0, which may lead to long-term depeg risks.The missing accounting of fee minting will cause a long-term de-pegging risk for all ETH0 holders as the protocol inflates ETH0 supply without matching wstETH collateral, allowing attackers or treasury owners to redeem unbacked ETH0 for real assets or undermine confidence in the stable asset.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* Subtract stableFee from the user's ETH0 before burning, and transfer that fee to treasury, e.g.:
```solidity
uint256 fee = _calculateFee(eth0Amount);
$.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount - fee);
$.eth0.transferFrom(msg.sender, $.treasuryYield, fee);
```
* If insisting on minting fee, ensure an equal amount of wstETH is moved from treasury or locked, to maintain the 1:1 ETH backing ratio.
