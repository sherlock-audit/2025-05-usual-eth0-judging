# Sandwiching `stEthPerToken()` updates with a `swap()` then `redeem()` to get more wstETH

### Summary

An attacker can sandwich `stEthPerToken()` updates to get more wstETH tokens.

### Root Cause

The protocol relies on [`stEthPerToken()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L86) to get the price of wstETH.

According to [Lido's documentation](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#what-is-wsteth):
> Normally, the rate gets updated once a day, when stETH undergoes a rebase. The current rate can be obtained by calling wstETH.stEthPerToken()....

In short,  `stEthPerToken()` is updated once a day.

So an attacker can sandwich `stEthPerToken` updates to get more tokens, see Attack Path.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

For the attack to be profitable, the price delta in 24 hours [reported by `stEthPerToken`] needs to cover the redeem fee loss to the attacker.

### Attack Path

1. `stEthPerToken` is reporting that the wstETH price is 1.2 ETH.
2. The attacker monitors the mempool, he sees the update tx pending (price is gonna go down).
3. The attacker submits a `swap` transaction with 1000 wstETH, he gets 1200 ETH0.
4. The update tx gets mined, updating the price to 1 wstETH = 1 ETH.
5. The attacker now backruns it with a redeem, getting 1200 wstETH [minus the redeem fee, if the fee is 10% he'd get 1080 wstETH, which is still extremely profitable (profiting with 80 wstETH in a matter of seconds)]

### Impact

- Every time there is a favorable change in conversion rate, anyone can exploit this by sandwiching the update, getting more wstETH than what they started with in a matter of seconds.

The impact is High since the profit can be huge, (which means loss to the protocol), but that depends on the price shift.
