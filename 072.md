# Proxy Delegatecall Vulnerability Allows Silent Failures Due to Non-Existent or Self-Destructed Implementation

### Summary

The DaoCollateral.sol, TokenMapping.sol, and Eth0.sol contracts utilize OpenZeppelin’s Proxy pattern without validating the existence of code at the implementation address. This vulnerability allows delegatecall operations to return success even if the implementation contract is non-existent or has been self-destructed, leading to silent failures in critical functions. Specifically, in DaoCollateral.sol (lines 504-505), the swap function can silently fail, causing users to lose 100% of their deposited collateral while transactions appear successful. Similarly, TokenMapping.sol and Eth0.sol fail to validate implementation contracts, disrupting token registration and management.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of code existence checks in the _implementation() function across DaoCollateral.sol, TokenMapping.sol, and Eth0.sol, which inherit from OpenZeppelin’s Proxy contract. This allows delegatecall to return false success signals when the implementation is invalid (e.g., self-destructed or set to a non-existent address).

### Internal Pre-conditions

The admin has upgrade rights to call updateImplementation() on proxy contracts.
Implementation contracts are upgradeable (with storage gaps).
DaoCollateral.sol, TokenMapping.sol, and Eth0.sol are initialized via the proxy pattern.
No code existence checks in _implementation().
No validation of delegatecall success in critical functions.


### External Pre-conditions

Implementation contracts support the SELFDESTRUCT opcode.
Sufficient gas is available for delegatecall operations.
The network allows contract self-destruction.
OpenZeppelin’s Proxy contract is used without additional validation.


### Attack Path

Implementation Destruction:
An attacker forces the implementation contract to self-destruct (e.g., via SELFDESTRUCT).
Subsequent operations (e.g., swap) return false success, causing users to lose funds while transactions appear successful.

Upgrade Attack:
An attacker gains admin rights (e.g., via governance exploit).
Updates the implementation to a non-existent address using updateImplementation().
The contract continues to “work” but performs no operations, leading to silent failures.

Vulnerable Code:
In DaoCollateral.sol (lines 504-505):

```solidity
function swap(address token, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut) external {
}```

In all proxy-based contracts:

```solidty
function _implementation() internal view override returns (address) {
    return implementation;
}```


### Impact

High Severity: Users of DaoCollateral.sol lose 100% of deposited collateral (e.g., 100 ETH in swap(wethToken, 100e18, 95e18)) as no tokens are minted, but the transaction returns success.
Users of Eth0.sol lose token value due to failed minting/burning operations.
Users of TokenMapping.sol cannot register or manage tokens, disrupting protocol operations.
The treasury cannot manage collateral or recover funds, leading to protocol-wide disruption.
Example: A user calls swap(wethToken, 100e18, 95e18), deposits 100 ETH, but no ETH0 tokens are minted, resulting in a permanent loss of 100 ETH.

Ran 1 test suite in 328.05ms (10.13ms CPU time): 2 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (2 total tests)

### Mitigation

Add implementation checks in the proxy:

```solidity

contract SecureProxy is Proxy {
    function _implementation() internal view virtual override returns (address implementation) {
        implementation =  ... get implementation address
        require(implementation != address(0), "Proxy: implementation not initialized");
        require(implementation.code.length > 0, "Proxy: implementation has no code");
        return implementation;
    }
}```
