# Oracle Price Fluctuations Can Violate Collateral Backing Invariant

### Summary

The protocol enforces the invariant that the amount of ETH0 in circulation must not exceed the ETH value of treasury-held collateral. However, this invariant can be broken post-mint due to a drop in oracle-reported collateral prices, resulting in ETH0 being undercollateralized even though all protocol checks were respected at the time of minting.

### Root Cause

In [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L152), the total ETH0 supply is checked against the ETH-denominated value of collateral at the time of minting using a live oracle. However, once minted, ETH0 tokens remain in circulation even if the price of backing collateral falls. This allows the total ETH0 supply to exceed the value of treasury collateral, breaking the stated invariant.

You can check here that there were previous cases where the price of wstETH fell - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth/eth

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The ETH-denominated price of one or more collateral tokens drops after minting occurs.

### Attack Path

1. At time T₀, the price of collateral (e.g., wstETH) is high enough to mint ETH0 up to the collateral value. Let's say 1 wstETH = 1.20 ETH. Assume we have 100 wstETH backing 120 ETH0

2. At time T₁, the price of the collateral falls (e.g., from 1.20 ETH/wstETH to 1.19 ETH/wstETH). Now we have 100 wstETH which are valued at 119 ETH and back 120 ETH0

3. The total ETH0 in circulation now exceeds the ETH value of treasury assets, breaking the protocol’s invariant.
