# maxDepegThreshold variable is not enough to validate depeg

### Summary

In case if any collateral token is depegged, then protocol plans to pause all functions, including minting and redeeming. Depeg is checked with `getPrice()` function of `AbstractOracle`.
`maxDepegThreshold` variable is used inside `AbstractOracle` to check if price of collateral token has depegged in any side.
```solidity
function _checkDepegPrice(address token, uint256 wadPriceInETH) internal view {
        AbstractOracleStorageV0 storage $ = _abstractOracleStorageV0();

        // Skip the check if the token is not a stablecoin
        if (!$.tokenToOracleInfo[token].isStablecoin) return;

        uint256 threshold = Math.mulDiv($.maxDepegThreshold, SCALAR_ONE, BASIS_POINT_BASE);

        if (wadPriceInETH > SCALAR_ONE + threshold || wadPriceInETH < SCALAR_ONE - threshold) {
            revert StablecoinDepeg();
        }
    }
```

Protocol plans to use LST collateral tokens. The price of those tokens are bigger than 1 eth and it increases during the time. This means that eventually the price would become equal to `SCALAR_ONE + threshold`, which will trigger depeg issue. In order to fix it admins will increase `maxDepegThreshold` value. While such move avoids depeg error, it also weakens the check for a lower side of depeg, which is much important than upper one. So, if we had `maxDepegThreshold` as 3% as example and then increased to 5%, then we allow price to go down to 95%, which is lower than 97% that we set at the beginning.

### Root Cause
During the time LST price will reach `maxDepegThreshold`, which will cause admins to increase the variable and loosen down side check.

### Internal Pre-conditions

LST price reaches `maxDepegThreshold` value.

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

-

### Impact

Depeg threshold for lower side of peg validation will be weaker.


### Mitigation

It's recommended to use separate variables for upper and lower side validation.
