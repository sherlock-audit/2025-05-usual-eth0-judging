# The prices returned by LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed are always the latest.

### Summary

When LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed(LidoWstEthOracle.sol) implements Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface, the `updatedAt` timestamp returned by its `latestRoundData` and `getRoundData` functions is hardcoded to `block.timestamp`. The Oracle(e.g., ClassicalOracle.sol) contract relies on this `updatedAt` timestamp and a configurable timeout to determine whether the price data is stale. Due to the implementation of LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed, the core price staleness verification mechanism based on updatedAt in Oracle will actually fail for price data from LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed. This weakens the system's defense against outdated prices and increases the risk of financial losses due to the use of inaccurate or stale price data.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed's updatedAt field in AggregatorV3Interface does not match Oracle's security assumptions:

- LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed's implementation: simply sets updatedAt to block.timestamp, indicating "the data is read at this moment".

- Oracle's expectations/security assumptions: expect updatedAt to represent the time when the underlying price data was last updated or verified.

- Core conflict: LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed's updatedAt does not reflect the actual "last update time" of the return value of its underlying data source IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken(), but reflects the time when LidoProxy itself is called.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The Oracle contract is deployed, and the address of the LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed contract is registered as the dataSource of a token (e.g. wstETH) in the Oracle.

- A positive timeout is configured for the dataSource in the Oracle (e.g., timeout = 1 hour).

- Other contracts in the system (e.g., DaoCollateral.sol) rely on the Oracle's getPrice() function to obtain the token price and make key economic decisions based on this price (e.g., calculating the collateral ratio).

### External Pre-conditions

The price data returned by the stEthPerToken() function in Lido's WST_ETH_CONTRACT may not always be updated in real time or may be delayed/deviant from the fair market price. For example:

- There is a delay in the price update mechanism of Lido DAO.

- There is a malfunction or bug in WST_ETH_CONTRACT itself, causing its exchange rate to get stuck at an old value but the function itself does not revert.

- During periods of extreme market volatility, the update speed of stEthPerToken() cannot keep up with market changes.

### Attack Path

1. Lido's stEthPerToken() is stuck at an outdated price P_stale for some reason (e.g. one of the external preconditions above), which is significantly higher or lower than the current fair market price P_market.

2. The attacker observes this price difference.

3. A user in the system (or an account controlled by the attacker) interacts with a protocol that relies on Oracle to obtain the price of wstETH (e.g. borrowing with wstETH as collateral in a lending protocol, or performing an oracle-based exchange).

4. The protocol calls Oracle.getPrice("wstETH_address").

5. Oracle internally calls LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.latestRoundData().

6. LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed returns answer = P_stale (obtained from stEthPerToken()), and updatedAt = block.timestamp (the current block time).

7. Oracle performs a freshness check: if (updatedAt == 0 || block.timestamp > updatedAt + timeout). Since updatedAt is set to block.timestamp, and assuming timeout > 0, the condition block.timestamp > block.timestamp + timeout is always false. Therefore, the Oracle will not revert due to stale price.

8. The Oracle accepts P_stale as a valid price and returns it to the caller.

9. The protocol performs an operation based on the wrong, outdated price P_stale.



### Impact

If P_stale is lower than P_market, users may receive far less assets than they deserve in exchange.

An attacker aware of this vulnerability could attempt to exploit price differences for arbitrage or malicious purposes.
