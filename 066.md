# Invariant Violation: ETH0 Not Fully Backed After Collateral Price Drop Enables Treasury Drain

### Summary

The system breaks its invariant: "We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury." A price drop in collateral before CBR activation allows users to drain the treasury, leaving outstanding ETH0 with no backing.

### Root Cause

The ETH0 stablecoin is designed to maintain a 1:1 backing with ETH-equivalent value held in the treasury. However, this invariant can break under certain market conditions—particularly when users [swaps](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L504-L518) for ETH0 at a high collateral token price, which later drops before (CBR) is activated and [redeems](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L538-L561) a part of their ETH0 to collateral token.

### Scenario 1: Early Redemption Drains Treasury

* **Alice** mints ETH0 using `100e18` collateral tokens.
* **Bob** mints shortly after using `11e18` collateral tokens.
* The collateral token price drops by 10%.

When Alice redeems her ETH0, the protocol must now return more tokens per ETH0 due to the price drop. Her redemption consumes all remaining collateral. Bob is left with ETH0 that’s no longer redeemable—there’s no collateral left.

### Scenario 2: Proportional Imbalance

* Alice mints `1000e18` ETH0 using `1000e18` collateral tokens.
* Collateral price drops: `1 token = 0.9 ETH0`.
* To redeem `1000e18` ETH0, the protocol now needs `1110e18` collateral tokens, but only `1000e18` exist.

If Alice redeems just `900e18` ETH0, she receives the full `1000e18` collateral, draining the treasury. She still holds `100e18` ETH0, but there’s now zero backing left—violating the 1:1 peg.

### Implications

* The system’s invariant is broken: ETH0 exists with no backing.
* A user can front-run redemption with higher gas before CBR activates.
* Even if CBR is active with a small buffer (e.g., `<1e18`), a sharp price drop can allow a user to drain the treasury before the CBR is updated.


### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price of collateral needs to drop

### Attack Path

Alice mints ETH0 using 100e6 collateral tokens.

Bob mints ETH0 shortly after using 11e6 collateral tokens.

The collateral token price drops by 10%.

Alice redeems her ETH0, and due to the price drop, all collateral in the treasury is consumed to meet her redemption.

Bob is left with ETH0 but cannot redeem it—there is no collateral left in the treasury.

### Impact

This is a clear breach of the system's core invariant and can lead to a full loss of backing for ETH0 tokens. Users can be left holding worthless ETH0 despite assuming a 1:1 backing. This undermines trust in the system and enables treasury draining attacks. There's always a high chance of token price dropping and due to the calculation, any user can redeem before CBR is activated. 

### PoC

```solidity
function testBrokenInvariant() public {
    uint256 amount = 1000e6; // initial amount for Alice
    uint256 bobAmount = (amount * 11) / 100; // Bob's amount (e.g. 11% of Alice's)

    (RwaMock token, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1_withMint(6, amount);

    uint256 amountInUsd = amount * 1e12;       // Alice's stablecoin amount
    uint256 bobAmountInUsd = bobAmount * 1e12; // Bob's stablecoin amount

    // Alice swaps
    vm.prank(alice);
    daoCollateral.swap(address(token), amount, amountInUsd);
    assertEq(stbc.balanceOf(alice), amountInUsd);

    // // Mint & approve for Bob too
    token.mint(bob, bobAmount);
    vm.prank(bob);
    token.approve(address(daoCollateral), bobAmount);

    // // Bob swaps after Alice
    vm.prank(bob);
    daoCollateral.swap(address(token), bobAmount, bobAmountInUsd);
    assertEq(stbc.balanceOf(bob), bobAmountInUsd);

    // Simulate price drop before redemptions
    uint256 newPrice = (10 ** 6) * 90 / 100; // 90% of original price
    _setOraclePrice(address(token), newPrice);

    // Alice redeems
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    uint256 aliceFee = _getDotOnePercent(amount);
    uint256 aliceEth0Amount = stbc.balanceOf(alice);
    daoCollateral.redeem(address(token), aliceEth0Amount, 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertEq(stbc.balanceOf(alice), 0);

     // ✅ Log treasury token balance after Alice redemption
    console.log("Treasury token balance after Alice redemption:", token.balanceOf(treasury));
    // treasury balance logs 0 for the collateral token

    // Expect Bob's redemption to fail due to insufficient treasury collateral
    vm.startPrank(bob);
    uint256 bobEth0Amount = stbc.balanceOf(bob);
    vm.expectRevert(); // catch revert on redemption
    daoCollateral.redeem(address(token), bobEth0Amount, 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // ✅ Log Bob's STBC balance after failed redemption
    console.log("Bob STBC balance after failed redemption:", stbc.balanceOf(bob));
    // bob still has this much 110000000000000000000 eth0 as balance
}
```

### Mitigation

Switch to a share-based redemption model.

Calculate the user’s share of the total ETH0 supply and redeem that fraction of the available collateral. This prevents draining the treasury and ensures proportional redemptions.

```solidity
// Share-based redemption per collateral
collateralToReturn = eth0Amount * collateralReserve[address(token)] / totalEth0IssuedAgainst[address(token)];
```
