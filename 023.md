# Incorrect Collateral Valuation in ETH0 Due to Missing stETH to ETH Price Conversion

### Summary

The protocol claims to use the on-chain **wstETH → stETH → ETH** rate as the source of truth for collateral valuation, following Aave’s precedent. This is intended to ensure accurate backing and gas efficiency. However, the current implementation only uses the **wstETH to stETH** exchange rate via `stEthPerToken` in `latestRoundData()` and **does not perform the final stETH to ETH conversion**.

As a result, the protocol implicitly assumes **1 stETH = 1 ETH**, which is not accurate in real market conditions. stETH and ETH are separate tokens with different risk. The price of stETH in terms of ETH **often deviates from 1:1**, especially during volatile or high-demand periods. For instance, if `1 wstETH = 1.2 stETH` and `1 stETH = 0.98 ETH`, then the actual collateral value in ETH is `1.176`, but the system wrongly assumes `1.2`.

This leads to an **overestimation of ETH collateral value** during minting of ETH0 tokens.

Historical price deviations between stETH and ETH can be verified on [CoinGecko’s stETH/ETH chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether/eth), where the ratio has fallen below 1.0 multiple times, confirming that assuming a 1:1 rate is incorrect and risky.

### Root Cause

When a user calls [swap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L504) or [Redeem()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L538)in the `DaoCollateral.sol` , it internally invokes the `getPrice()` function, which subsequently calls `ClassicOracle::_latestRoundData()`. This `_latestRoundData()` implementation calls the `LidoWstEthOracle::latestRoundData`:

```solidity
function latestRoundData()
    external
    view
    returns (
        uint80 roundId,
        int256 answer,
        uint256 startedAt,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80 answeredInRound
    )
{
    // Return mock data for all fields except answer
    roundId = 1;
    answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
    startedAt = block.timestamp;
    updatedAt = block.timestamp;
    answeredInRound = 1;
}
```

This function only returns the value of `wstETH → stETH` via `stEthPerToken()`, **without converting it further to ETH**. The protocol then uses this value directly to determine the ETH0 mint amount. This implicitly assumes **1 stETH = 1 ETH**, which is incorrect and leads to overvaluation of collateral and underestimation of protocol risk.


### Internal Pre-conditions

Minting or redeeming ETH0 tokens with wstETH as collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

Variations in the stETH to ETH market price.

### Attack Path

No explicit attack path, but the overvaluation can be exploited indirectly through minting over-collateralized tokens

### Impact

* The protocol mints more ETH0 tokens than the actual ETH value of the collateral, risking undercollateralization.
* This can cause peg instability, liquidation risks, and user fund losses.
* It undermines the protocol’s safety guarantees and user trust.

### PoC

Sure! Here's an improved, detailed PoC section explaining the overvaluation clearly:

**PoC**
Suppose the current rates are:

* 1 wstETH = 1.2 stETH
* 1 stETH = 0.98 ETH

The protocol’s current implementation only reads the wstETH → stETH rate (1.2) and assumes 1 stETH = 1 ETH implicitly. Therefore, when a user deposits 1 wstETH as collateral, the protocol calculates the collateral value as 1.2 ETH instead of the accurate value of 1.176 ETH (1.2 × 0.98).

This discrepancy leads the protocol to mint ETH0 tokens against an inflated collateral value by approximately 2.4% ( (1.2 - 1.176) / 1.176 ). As a result, users can obtain more tokens than their actual ETH-equivalent collateral, increasing the risk of undercollateralization and potential losses during market downturns.


### Mitigation

Integrate a stETH → ETH price oracle.
