# The redeemDao function does not check minAmountOut and is vulnerable to slippage

### Summary

There is no check for minAmountOut in the redeemDao function, which is vulnerable to slippage. There is a slippage check in the redeem function, but not in the redeemDao function. When there is volatility in the wstETH price, the DAO may be forced to accept slippage losses.

### Root Cause

There is no check for minAmountOut in the [redeemDao](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L564) function, which is vulnerable to slippage. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

wstETH experienced slippage

### Attack Path

1. The DAO calls the redeemDao function, the wstETH price fluctuates, and redeemDao suffers slippage losses.

### Impact

the DAO may be forced to accept slippage losses.
