# Unpauser Role Overrides Admin’s CBR-Initiated Swap Pause in DaoCollateral

### Summary

 The missing`CBR` state check in DaoCollateral.sol’s `unpauseSwap()` function will cause severe protocol instability and potential insolvency for the protocol as the `UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE` will `inadvertently` or `maliciously` unpause swaps specifically initiated by the admin’s `activateCBR()` when `isCBROn` is `true`, bypassing critical Counter Bank Run (CBR) protections and enabling unauthorized swaps that deplete collateral reserves during a bank run.



### Root Cause

The issue stems from a design flaw in [`DaoCollateral.sol:308` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L308).  The `unpauseSwap` function only checks two conditions:
Whether swaps are paused `(_swapPaused == true)`.

Whether the caller has the `UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE`.

It does not verify the CBR status `(isCBROn)` which is set to true when [`activateCBR`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L247) is called to `pause swaps` during a bank run. This oversight allows the unpauser to unpause swaps even when CBR is active undermining the admin’s authority and the intended protection mechanism.

This issue is particularly critical because it can be triggered either maliciously or accidentally. An unpauser might genuinely believe they're undoing a regular pause initiated by `pauseSwap`  when in fact they're overriding a critical CBR protection.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin must call activateCBR() which:

      - Sets isCBROn = true.
      - Sets _swapPaused = true.
      
2. Swaps must be in a paused state triggered by either:

      - The admin via `activateCBR()`.
      - The pauser via `pauseSwap()`.

3. The caller of unpauseSwap must have the `UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE`.



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The `admin` detects a bank run and calls `activateCBR(coefficient)` setting:

      - isCBROn = true.
      - _swapPaused = true to halt swaps and protect collateral reserves.
2. An account with `UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE` calls `unpauseSwap()`

-    The unpauser may act:
     Maliciously intentionally overriding the CBR pause to destabilize the protocol.
     Mistakenly believing they are unpausing a regular pause from `pauseSwap()` rather than the admin’s CBR          protection

3. Users call `swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut)` during the bank run






### Impact

The protocol’s CBR protection fails enabling users to swap collateral for ETH0 during a bank run increasing ETH0 supply and risking under-collateralization and insolvency.







### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check for `isCBROn` in the `unpauseSwap` function to prevent unpausing swaps during CBR mode:

```solidity
function unpauseSwap() external whenSwapPaused {
    _requireOnlyUnpauser();
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    if ($.isCBROn) {
        revert("Cannot unpause swaps during CBR");
    }
    $._swapPaused = false;
    emit SwapUnPaused();
}
```
