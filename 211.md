# Decimals normalization reducing stableFee acrued for non-18 underlying assets

### Summary

Each time redeem() called we expect to gather some portion of collateral in order to distribute it latter on.
The problem occurs while redeem() -> _calculateFee() call:
```solidity
    function redeem(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenRedeemNotPaused
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Amount can't be 0
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }

        // check that collateralToken is a collateral token
        if (!_daoCollateralStorageV0().tokenMapping.isEth0Collateral(collateralToken)) {
            revert InvalidToken();
        }
@>        uint256 stableFee = _calculateFee(amount, collateralToken); <@
        uint256 returnedCollateral =                                //^^
            _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, stableFee);
        // Check if the amount is greater than the minAmountOut
        if (returnedCollateral < minAmountOut) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }
        emit Redeem(msg.sender, collateralToken, amount, returnedCollateral, stableFee);
    }
```
It casts collateral token (the underlying one, in current state it's wstETH) as a decimals to which one fee should be normalized.
```solidity
    function _calculateFee(uint256 eth0Amount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 stableFee)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
@>        stableFee = Math.mulDiv(eth0Amount, $.redeemFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals(); <@
        // if the token has less decimals than ETH0 we need to normalize the fee
        if (tokenDecimals < 18) {
            // we scale down the fee to the token decimals
            // and we scale it up to 18 decimals
@>            stableFee = Normalize.tokenAmountToWad(
                Normalize.wadAmountToDecimals(stableFee, tokenDecimals), tokenDecimals
            );
        }
    }
```
While fee itself applied to ETH0 amount which is 18 decimals. Hence, our fee will be truncated -> if it was 111 111 111 111 111 111 amount of fee then it will become 111 111 100 000 000 000 

### Root Cause

_calculateFee() normalizing decimals while fee taken based on ETH0 amount, hence, even if token don't have != 18 decimals we shouldn't normalize anything

### Internal Pre-conditions

For impact it should be added tokens with lower then 18 decimals ( any eth backed asset could be added to the protocol, so it doesn't really need to be ETH LST with non 18 decimals)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Will happens itself
1. Usual add any non 18 decimals underlying
2. stableFee amount reduced, as extra decimals truncated -> stakers receives less rewards

### Impact

 stableFee amount reduced, as extra decimals truncated -> stakers receives less rewards
