# Malicious Registry Misconfiguration

### Summary

The setContract function in the RegistryContract allows an admin with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to update the addresses of critical contracts  stored in the registry, with minimal validation beyond role checks and non-null address requirements. This centralization of control introduces a significant vulnerability: a malicious or compromised admin could replace legitimate contract addresses with attacker-controlled ones, enabling severe attacks such as fund theft, price manipulation, or protocol disruption. The absence of governance mechanisms like timelocks or multi-signature approvals exacerbates the risk, potentially leading to substantial financial losses (exceeding 1% of protocol funds, meeting Sherlock's high-severity threshold) and reputational damage.

### Root Cause

The root cause is a design flaw in the setContract function .The function relies solely on the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for access control, with no additional safeguards to prevent malicious updates. This allows an admin to instantly replace critical contract addresses, affecting all dependent contracts that rely on the registry.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin Role Assignment: The attacker must hold the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE. The setContract function checks this via IRegistryAccess($._registryAccess).hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender). The contract’s role storage (managed by the registryAccess contract) must reflect that the attacker’s address has this role.

Registry Initialized: The contract must be initialized with a valid registryAccess address. The initialize function sets $._registryAccess = registryAccess_ , which must be a non-zero address (registryAccess_ != address(0)). Without initialization, the contract cannot function, and setContract will fail.

Target Contract Name Exists: The name parameter must correspond to a key used by other contracts in the protocol. While setContract allows any non-null name, the attack’s impact depends on name being a critical key that dependent contracts query via getContract.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The attacker gains control of the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE through a compromised admin account or role assignment flaw in the registryAccess system.
The attacker calls setContract to replace CONTRACT_TREASURY with an attacker-controlled address.
Dependent contracts query the registry via getContract, retrieving the malicious address for CONTRACT_TREASURY .
Collateral transfers in DaoCollateral are redirected to the attacker’s address, allowing theft of assets like wstETH during redemption .
Alternatively, the attacker sets CONTRACT_ORACLE to a fake oracle, manipulating prices to enable over-minting or excessive redemptions, further draining protocol reserves.

### Impact

Fund Theft via Treasury Misconfiguration: By setting CONTRACT_TREASURY to an attacker-controlled address, collateral transfers can be redirected, allowing the attacker to steal assets like wstETH.

Price Manipulation via Oracle Misconfiguration: Replacing CONTRACT_ORACLE with a fake oracle enables the attacker to manipulate prices, facilitating over-minting of Eth0 tokens or excessive redemptions, draining reserves.

Protocol Disruption: Misconfiguring contracts like CONTRACT_TOKEN_MAPPING or CONTRACT_REGISTRY_ACCESS can break system functionality, leading to denial-of-service or unauthorized access.

Financial Loss: Such attacks could result in losses exceeding 1% of protocol funds (Sherlock high-severity threshold), as collateral assets are siphoned or the token supply is inflated.

Reputational Damage: Perceived centralization risks and potential exploitation could erode user trust, reducing protocol adoption.

### Mitigation

Implement a Timelock Mechanism: Require a delay before address updates take effect, allowing users and governance to detect and respond to suspicious changes.
