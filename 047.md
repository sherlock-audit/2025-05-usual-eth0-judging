# Unrestricted CBR Activation Allows Admin to Freeze Swaps and Manipulate Redemptions

### Summary

Admin-controlled CBR activation will cause fund loss and swap freezes for all users as a malicious/compromised admin will set extreme CBR coefficients and pause swaps in one transaction.

### Root Cause

in `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L247-L261`, Only checks admin role (_requireOnlyAdmin()):

Has no multi-sig requirement, locks swaps immediately. This gives one admin too much power over user funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.Admin needs to call activateCBR() to set isCBROn to be exactly true
2.Admin needs to call activateCBR() to set _swapPaused to be exactly true
3.Admin role must not require multi-sig approval

### External Pre-conditions

1.Governance token holders must not exit when swaps are paused
2.Oracle prices must remain stable during protocol freezes


### Attack Path

1.Attacker gains admin privileges 
2.Attacker calls activateCBR() with any coefficient value

### Impact

1.Users unable to rebalance portfolios during market movements.
2.Loss of trust in protocol's reliability.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1.Implement 24-72 hour timelock for CBR activation.
2.Require multiple trusted parties to approve CBR activation.
