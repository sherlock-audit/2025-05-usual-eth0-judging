# redeem fee precision loss allows users to avoid part of the fee and causes protocol revenue loss

### Summary

Due to precision loss in fee calculation, when a user redeems a small token amount, the computed fee can become so small that it rounds down to zero. This allows users to avoid paying any fee on such redemptions, as long as the redeemed amount is small enough. More importantly, if many users exploit this behavior over time by attaching small extra amounts to minimize fees, the protocol could gradually suffer a noticeable and continuous loss in revenue.

### Root Cause

In [DaoCollateral.sol#L458-L464](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L458-L464), the fee is calculated during redemption as follows:

```solidity
    stableFee = Normalize.tokenAmountToWad(
        Normalize.wadAmountToDecimals(stableFee, tokenDecimals), tokenDecimals
    );
```
If the collateral token has fewer decimals than 18, then:
1. The fee is scaled down from `18` decimals to the token’s decimal level.
2. Then it’s scaled back up to `18` decimals.

Because both steps use flooring division, any `stableFee` less than `10 ** (18 - tokenDecimals)` will round to zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The user has already swapped and currently holds some `ETH0` tokens.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Let’s consider a scenario based on existing test cases from the `RWA` to `ETH0` flow:

1. A user holds `ETH0` tokens and wants to `redeem` them into a `RWA` token.
2. The user intentionally sets the redeem amount to an integer plus a tiny dust value just below the fee threshold (e.g. `1e15 - 1`).
3. The user completes the redemption without paying any fee to `1e15 - 1` part.

This behavior can be repeated by any user to consistently bypass part of the fee.

### Impact

If users deliberately split their redemptions into many small transactions, the gas cost would make the attack inefficient.
However, users may consistently include small dust amounts in regular transactions to slightly reduce or avoid fees. If this behavior becomes widespread, the protocol could gradually lose a meaningful portion of its fee revenue over time.

### PoC

Here is a coded PoC that demonstrates the issue described above. To make the issue more apparent, we directly call redeem with the amount set to `1e15 - 1`, using a collateral token that has fewer than `18` decimals (e.g., RWA with `6` decimals). As expected, the calculated fee becomes zero due to precision loss.

Add the following test case to `test/DaoCollateral.t.sol`:

```solidity
    function testRedeemCalculateFee() public {
        uint256 rwaAmount = 1e18;
        uint256 redeemAmount = 1e15 - 1;

        // Setup: initialize RWA token with 6 decimals and set oracle price ($1)
        (RwaMock rwa1, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1(6);
        _setOraclePrice(address(rwa1), 1e6);

        // Prepare Bob's initial state and mint RWA tokens
        uint256 amountInRWA = (rwaAmount * 1e18) / classicalOracle.getPrice(address(rwa1));
        _whitelistRWA(address(rwa1), bob);
        rwa1.mint(bob, rwaAmount);

        // 1: Step 1: Swap RWA to ETH0
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        ERC20(address(rwa1)).approve(address(daoCollateral), amountInRWA);
        daoCollateral.swap(address(rwa1), amountInRWA, 0);

        // Step 2: Redeem a small amount just below the fee threshold
        stbc.approve(address(daoCollateral), ERC20(address(stbc)).balanceOf(bob));
        daoCollateral.redeem(address(rwa1), redeemAmount, 0);
        // Because of precision loss, this redemption pays no fee
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

Then run it using:

```shell
forge test --mt testRedeemCalculateFee -vvvv

```
The logs show:

The emitted event shows that `stableFeeAmount` is `0`, confirming that no fee was charged.

### Mitigation

Consider rounding up the fee calculation to make sure even small amounts are not reduced to zero. Alternatively, the protocol can require users to redeem integer amounts only, or internally truncate the input amount to the nearest decimals whole unit(based on the token’s decimals) before calculating the fee.
