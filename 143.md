# Missing Slippage Protection in CBR Mode - Unexpected Collateral Reduction

### Summary

Missing slippage protection for CBR coefficient application will cause an unexpected significant financial loss for users as the admin will activate CBR during user redemption transactions, reducing collateral output without user consent or awareness

### Root Cause

In DaoCollateral.sol the _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH() function applies the CBR coefficient to reduce collateral amounts without any slippage protection mechanism, allowing users to receive drastically less collateral than anticipated when CBR is activated between transaction submission and execution.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L428C5-L441C1

```solidity
    function _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(uint256 wadStableAmount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 amountInToken)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        amountInToken = _getQuoteInTokenFromETH(wadStableAmount, collateralToken);
        // if cbr is on we need to apply the coef to the collateral price
        // cbrCoef should be less than 1e18
        if ($.isCBROn) {
            amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        }
    }


```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call activateCBR(coefficient) to set isCBROn to be true and cbrCoef to be less than SCALAR_ONE (e.g., 0.8e18 for 20% reduction)
User needs to submit a redemption transaction with minAmountOut parameter based on non-CBR calculations
CBR activation needs to occur between user transaction submission and execution

### External Pre-conditions

Network congestion needs to create sufficient delay between transaction submission and execution to allow CBR activation to frontrun user transactions
Crisis conditions need to develop rapidly requiring immediate CBR activation

### Attack Path

```solidity
User calculates expected collateral output off-chain

User wants to redeem 1000 ETH0
Calculates expected output: ~975 wstETH (after 2.5% fee)
Sets minAmountOut = 950 wstETH (2.5% slippage tolerance)
Submits redeem(wstETH, 1000e18, 950e18) transaction to mempool


Crisis develops and admin activates CBR

Admin calls activateCBR(0.8e18) with 20% reduction coefficient
CBR activation transaction has higher gas price and executes first
Sets $.isCBROn = true and $.cbrCoef = 0.8e18


User redemption executes under CBR conditions

redeem() function calls _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral()
User's 1000 ETH0 is burned
25 ETH0 fee is minted to yield treasury
_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH() calculates collateral amount
CBR coefficient applied: 975 * 0.8 = 780 wstETH
User receives 780 wstETH instead of expected 975 wstETH


Slippage check passes but user suffers unexpected loss

780 wstETH >= 950 wstETH fails, so transaction would revert
BUT if user set looser slippage (e.g., minAmountOut = 700), transaction succeeds
User loses 195 wstETH (20% reduction) without explicit consent
```

### Impact

Users suffer an approximate loss of up to 50% of their expected collateral output (depending on CBR coefficient) during redemptions when CBR is activated mid-transaction. Users cannot predict or protect against this loss as their slippage protection calculations become invalid under CBR conditions.
The severity increases with:

CBR coefficient severity (lower coefficient = higher loss)
Transaction value (larger redemptions = larger absolute losses)
Timing precision of CBR activation relative to user transactions

### PoC

```solidity
function testCBRSlippageProtectionMissing() public {
    // Setup initial state
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.initialize(registryContract, 250); // 2.5% fee
    
    // User calculates expected output without CBR
    uint256 redeemAmount = 1000e18; // 1000 ETH0
    uint256 expectedFee = (redeemAmount * 250) / 10000; // 25 ETH0 fee
    uint256 expectedNet = redeemAmount - expectedFee; // 975 ETH0
    uint256 expectedCollateral = 975e18; // Assuming 1:1 rate for simplicity
    
    // User sets reasonable slippage tolerance (5%)
    uint256 minAmountOut = (expectedCollateral * 95) / 100; // 926.25 wstETH
    
    console.log("Expected collateral without CBR:", expectedCollateral);
    console.log("User's slippage protection:", minAmountOut);
    
    // Simulate user transaction in mempool
    // Admin activates CBR with 30% reduction before user tx executes
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.activateCBR(0.7e18); // 30% reduction
    
    // Fund user and approve
    deal(address(eth0), user, redeemAmount);
    vm.prank(user);
    eth0.approve(address(daoCollateral), redeemAmount);
    
    // User redemption executes under CBR
    vm.prank(user);
    daoCollateral.redeem(wstETH, redeemAmount, minAmountOut);
    
    // Check actual collateral received
    uint256 actualCollateral = IERC20(wstETH).balanceOf(user);
    uint256 expectedWithCBR = (expectedCollateral * 7) / 10; // 70% of expected
    
    console.log("Actual collateral with CBR:", actualCollateral);
    console.log("Expected with CBR coefficient:", expectedWithCBR);
    console.log("User loss due to CBR:", expectedCollateral - actualCollateral);
    
    // Verify user received CBR-reduced amount
    assertEq(actualCollateral, expectedWithCBR);
    
    // Calculate user's unexpected loss
    uint256 unexpectedLoss = expectedCollateral - actualCollateral;
    assertEq(unexpectedLoss, expectedCollateral * 3 / 10); // 30% loss
    
    console.log("User's unexpected loss percentage:", (unexpectedLoss * 100) / expectedCollateral);
}

function testCBRSlippageProtectionFailure() public {
    // Test case where user's slippage protection fails completely
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.initialize(registryContract, 250);
    
    uint256 redeemAmount = 1000e18;
    uint256 expectedCollateral = 975e18; // After fees
    uint256 minAmountOut = 950e18; // 2.5% slippage tolerance
    
    // Admin activates severe CBR (50% reduction)
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.activateCBR(0.5e18);
    
    deal(address(eth0), user, redeemAmount);
    vm.prank(user);
    eth0.approve(address(daoCollateral), redeemAmount);
    
    // User transaction should revert due to slippage protection
    vm.prank(user);
    vm.expectRevert(AmountTooLow.selector);
    daoCollateral.redeem(wstETH, redeemAmount, minAmountOut);
    
    // But user's ETH0 would be burned if slippage check was after asset movement
    // This demonstrates the critical timing of slippage protection
}
