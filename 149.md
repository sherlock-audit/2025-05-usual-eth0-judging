# Design Flaws in CBR Implementation


## Finding description and impact

### Root Cause

The protocol applies conflicting economic rules depending on whether the Collateral Backup Ratio (CBR) is enabled or disabled, resulting in a two-fold penalty that jeopardizes system resilience when it is most needed.

**When CBR is ON:**

* The collateral returned to users is reduced by applying a coefficient:

  ```solidity
  amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor)
  ```
* Any stable fees collected are neither retained nor redirected, because the condition `if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn)` fails, so no fees are minted.

**When CBR is OFF:**

* Users receive the full collateral amount (no coefficient adjustment).
* Collected fees are minted and sent to the treasury yield via:

  ```solidity
  $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee)
  ```

### Impact

1. Participants incur harsher penalties precisely when the protocol is under stress (CBR is active), which may provoke a rush to withdraw funds and exacerbate instability.

2.  During CBR periods, users suffer two simultaneous losses:

   * A lower collateral payout due to the coefficient adjustment.
   * Total forfeiture of fees, eliminating any potential yield.

3.  When the system is most in need of additional reserves, fee revenue is entirely eliminated instead of being redirected to support stability.

4.  Rational users will avoid engaging with the protocol while CBR is active, reducing liquidity exactly when it is most needed and accelerating collateral shortfalls.

## Mitigation

#### Revised CBR Fee Handling

```solidity
// Allocate fees in a way that reinforces stability during CBR events
if (stableFee > 0) {
    if ($.isCBROn) {
        // During CBR, direct fees to a dedicated stability reserve
        $.eth0.mint($.stabilityReserve, stableFee);
    } else {
        // Under normal conditions, route fees to the treasury yield
        $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee);
    }
}
```
