# Incorrect decimals truncation will result in protocol loss fees

### Summary

In the _calculateFee function, stableFee is first converted into the decimals of collateralToken, and then the decimals are converted into 18.If the decimals of collateralToken are 6, that is, the last 12 positions are 0.But in fact, stableFee represents the amount of eth0 that should be charged a fee.
```solidity
        uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals();
        if (tokenDecimals < 18) {
            stableFee = Normalize.tokenAmountToWad(
                Normalize.wadAmountToDecimals(stableFee, tokenDecimals),
                tokenDecimals
            );
        }
```
So in the end, the protocol will lose the last 12 bits of fee every time it redeems. Cumulatively, this is not a small amount.

In addition, attackers can bypass the fee through this. If the fee is 1/10,000, attackers can take 0.009ETH0 without any handling fee, because it is truncated by 6-digit decimals.

### Root Cause

In the [_calculateFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L458-L464) function, decimals were truncated by mistake.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There exists a collateralToken with decimals less than 18.
2. There is a handling fee for the protocol

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user swaps.
2. Then redeem. The fee will be truncated, resulting in a loss of protocol fees.

### Impact

The fee will be truncated, resulting in a loss of protocol fees.
