# CBR State Inconsistency - Permanent Swap Pause After CBR Deactivation

### Summary

Incomplete state restoration in CBR deactivation will cause a permanent swap functionality loss for all users as the admin will deactivate CBR without restoring normal swap operations

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L264C5-L270C6

### Root Cause

In DaoCollateral.sol the deactivateCBR() function only sets isCBROn = false but fails to restore the _swapPaused state that was automatically set during CBR activation, creating an inconsistent contract state where CBR is inactive but swaps remain permanently disabled.

```solidity
    function deactivateCBR() external {
        _requireOnlyAdmin();
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        if ($.isCBROn == false) revert SameValue();
        $.isCBROn = false;
        emit CBRDeactivated();
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call activateCBR(coefficient) to set isCBROn to be true and _swapPaused to be true
Admin needs to call deactivateCBR() to set isCBROn to be false while leaving _swapPaused as true

### External Pre-conditions

None required - this is purely an internal state management issue.


### Attack Path

Admin calls activateCBR(0.8e18) during a crisis situation

Sets $.isCBROn = true
Sets $._swapPaused = true (automatic swap pause)
Sets $.cbrCoef = 0.8e18
Emits CBRActivated and SwapPaused events


Crisis resolves and admin calls deactivateCBR()

Sets $.isCBROn = false
Emits CBRDeactivated event
FAILS to set $._swapPaused = false
FAILS to emit SwapUnPaused event


Users attempt to call swap() function

Function has whenSwapNotPaused modifier
Modifier checks $._swapPaused which is still true
Transaction reverts with SwapMustNotBePaused() error


Admin must manually call unpauseSwap() to restore functionality

Requires separate transaction and gas cost
May be forgotten or delayed
Creates operational complexity and potential for permanent dysfunction

### Impact

All users cannot execute swap operations indefinitely after CBR deactivation, requiring manual admin intervention to restore basic protocol functionality. The protocol suffers operational degradation and revenue loss during the period swaps remain disabled.

### PoC

```solidity
function testCBRStateInconsistency() public {
    // Setup
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.initialize(registryContract, 250); // 2.5% redeem fee
    
    // Admin activates CBR during crisis
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.activateCBR(0.8e18); // 80% coefficient
    
    // Verify CBR is active and swaps are paused
    assertTrue(daoCollateral.isCBROn());
    assertTrue(daoCollateral.isSwapPaused());
    
    // Crisis resolves, admin deactivates CBR
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.deactivateCBR();
    
    // Verify CBR is deactivated BUT swaps still paused (BUG)
    assertFalse(daoCollateral.isCBROn());
    assertTrue(daoCollateral.isSwapPaused()); 
    
    // User attempts to swap but fails
    vm.prank(user);
    vm.expectRevert(SwapMustNotBePaused.selector);
    daoCollateral.swap(wstETH, 100e18, 95e18);
    
    // Admin must manually unpause swaps
    vm.prank(admin);
    daoCollateral.unpauseSwap();
    
    // Now swaps work
    assertFalse(daoCollateral.isSwapPaused());
    
    vm.prank(user);
    daoCollateral.swap(wstETH, 100e18, 95e18); 
}
```

### Mitigation

Fix the deactivateCBR() function to atomically restore all related state
