# Lack of Slippage Protection in `redeemDao()` Function Results in Unexpected Collateral Returns

### Summary

The `redeemDao()` function in the **DaoCollateral contract** lacks slippage protection mechanisms that are present in other similar functions (`swap()` and `redeem()`). This can result in the **dao redeemer** receiving unexpected amounts of collateral tokens during redemption operations, as the function does not validate that the returned collateral meets minimum expected thresholds.

### Root Cause

The [`redeemDao()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L563-L581) function does not include a `minAmountOut` parameter for slippage protection, unlike the `swap()` and `redeem()` functions. This design inconsistency means the **dao redeemer** has no way to ensure that the collateral amount returned matches their expectations based on current market conditions or oracle prices

### Internal Pre-conditions

DAO redemption role (`DAO_REDEMPTION_ROLE`) must be assigned to an address/contract

### External Pre-conditions

Market conditions affecting **wstETH/ETH** conversion rates may change during transaction processing

### Attack Path

1. DAO redeemer calculates expected collateral return based on current oracle prices
2. DAO redeemer submits `redeemDao()` transaction with **ETH0** amount to redeem
3. Between submission and execution, oracle prices or **wstETH/ETH** rates naturally fluctuate
4. Transaction executes with different conversion rate than originally expected
5. **Unexpected Return:** DAO redeemer receives different (potentially significantly less) collateral than anticipated, with no way to revert the transaction

### Impact

**Unexpected Collateral Returns:** DAO redeemer may result in receiving significantly different amounts of collateral than expected

### PoC

```solidity
Scenario: DAO wants to redeem 100 ETH0 for wstETH

1. DAO operator checks current wstETH/ETH rate: 1.05 (expects ~95.24 wstETH)
2. DAO submits redeemDao(wstETH, 100e18) transaction
3. Due to network congestion, transaction is delayed for several minutes
4. During this time, wstETH/ETH rate naturally shifts to 1.08 due to market conditions
5. Transaction executes at the new rate
6. DAO receives ~92.59 wstETH instead of expected ~95.24 wstETH
7. Difference: ~2.65 wstETH (~2.78 ETH equivalent) less than expected
8. DAO has no way to revert or protect against this outcome
```

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection parameter to the `redeemDao()` function:
```solidity
function redeemDao(
    address collateralToken, 
    uint256 amount, 
    uint256 minAmountOut
) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    if (amount == 0) {
        revert AmountIsZero();
    }
    
    _requireOnlyDaoRedeemer();
    
    if (!_daoCollateralStorageV0().tokenMapping.isEth0Collateral(collateralToken)) {
        revert InvalidToken();
    }
    
    uint256 returnedCollateral = _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, 0);
    
    // Add slippage protection
    if (returnedCollateral < minAmountOut) {
        revert AmountTooLow();
    }
    
    emit Redeem(msg.sender, collateralToken, amount, returnedCollateral, 0);
}
```
