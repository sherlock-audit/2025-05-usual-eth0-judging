# Oracle Price Data Stale Detection Timeout Excessive Duration Vulnerability

### Summary

The ETH0 protocol's Oracle system allows for excessively long price data staleness detection timeouts of up to 7 days (ONE_WEEK). This configuration creates significant risks for price manipulation, delayed liquidations, and system financial losses. The timeout period far exceeds industry standards for DeFi protocols and Chainlink oracle heartbeats, potentially allowing the system to operate with severely outdated price information.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability originates from the overly permissive timeout validation in the `initializeTokenOracle` function:
[src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol:initializeTokenOracle#L54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L54)
```solidity
// In ClassicalOracle.sol
if (timeout == 0 || timeout > ONE_WEEK) revert InvalidTimeout();
```

The `ONE_WEEK` constant (7 days) as the maximum allowed timeout is significantly longer than:
- Chainlink's standard heartbeat intervals (1-4 hours for major assets)
- Industry best practices for DeFi protocols (typically 1-24 hours maximum)
- Reasonable staleness detection for financial operations

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Oracle Configuration**: An administrator must call `initializeTokenOracle()` with a timeout value approaching the maximum limit (up to 7 days)
2. **Asset Registration**: The system must have tokens registered with long timeout periods
3. **Price Dependencies**: Core functions like `swap()`, `redeem()`, and `mint()` must rely on these oracle price feeds
4. **No Additional Price Validation**: The system lacks secondary price validation mechanisms

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Oracle Data Interruption**: The Chainlink aggregator or data source stops updating price data
2. **Market Volatility**: Significant price movements occur in the underlying assets while oracle data remains stale
3. **Time Passage**: The stale data period must exceed reasonable market reaction times but remain within the configured timeout
4. **User Activity**: Users must continue interacting with the protocol during the stale data period

### Attack Path

### Scenario 1: Overvalued Collateral Exploitation
1. **Setup**: Administrator configures stETH oracle with 6-day timeout
2. **Oracle Failure**: Chainlink stETH/ETH price feed stops updating at $2000/ETH
3. **Market Movement**: Actual ETH price drops to $1500 over 5 days due to market crash
4. **Exploitation**: Attacker swaps stETH (worth $1500) for ETH0 valued at $2000 rate
5. **Profit**: Attacker gains ~33% profit by exploiting stale pricing

### Scenario 2: Delayed Liquidation Scenario
1. **User Position**: User has ETH collateral worth $1000, borrowed $800 ETH0 (80% LTV)
2. **Price Drop**: ETH drops 30% to $700, requiring liquidation
3. **Stale Oracle**: Oracle still shows $1000 ETH price for 4 days
4. **System Risk**: Position remains unliquidated, creating bad debt
5. **Loss Realization**: When oracle updates, system faces $100+ bad debt

### Scenario 3: Stablecoin Depeg Exploitation
1. **Configuration**: USDC oracle configured with 7-day timeout
2. **Depeg Event**: USDC depegs to $0.95 due to regulatory issues
3. **Stale Pricing**: Oracle continues reporting $1.00 for 6 days
4. **Arbitrage**: Users swap depegged USDC for full-value ETH0
5. **System Loss**: Protocol accepts undervalued collateral at full price

### Impact

### High Severity Financial Impact:
- **Price Manipulation**: Users can exploit stale prices for significant profit at protocol expense
- **Liquidation Failure**: Undercollateralized positions remain open, creating bad debt
- **Collateral Risk**: System may accept worthless or devalued assets at historical prices
- **Arbitrage Losses**: Systematic value extraction through price discrepancies

### Operational Impact:
- **User Trust**: Delayed price updates undermine protocol reliability
- **Risk Management**: Inability to respond to market volatility in reasonable timeframes
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Extended stale periods may violate compliance requirements for financial services

### Quantified Risk Examples:
- 30% ETH price drop over 5 days = potential 30% loss on affected collateral
- Stablecoin depeg to $0.95 = 5% immediate loss on stablecoin positions
- Oracle downtime during high volatility = compounded losses during recovery

### PoC

This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the **critical risks introduced by stale oracle data** in a DeFi protocol relying on price feeds for swaps and liquidations. The PoC explores **two distinct attack vectors** that arise when the oracle stops updating and no mechanism exists to detect or reject outdated prices:

---

### 1.  Stale Price Exploit on Swaps

An attacker exploits the fact that the protocol continues to accept **stale oracle prices** as valid:

* The oracle price for `stETH` remains at \$2000 even after 5 days of market inactivity.
* The real-world price drops to \$1500, but the protocol still overvalues stETH.
* The attacker swaps 100 stETH (worth \$150,000) for 200,000 ETH0, gaining a **risk-free \$50,000 profit**.
* This scenario simulates a **typical stale price oracle exploit**, which has been used in real-world attacks.

---

### 2. Liquidation Failure Due to Stale Prices

When price data is stale, **collateral positions cannot be accurately liquidated**, which leads to bad debt:

* A user opens a position by depositing ETH at \$2000.
* The market crashes to \$1200, but the oracle remains stale and reports \$2000.
* Liquidation conditions are never met, even though the position is clearly undercollateralized.
* After the oracle updates 7 days later, liquidation is triggered—but by then, the protocol has already absorbed **significant unrealized loss**.

### Mitigation

This mitigation introduces granular timeout constraints for oracle data freshness, tailored to the risk profile of different asset classes. The goal is to prevent stale oracle data from being accepted by the protocol—especially in critical operations such as swaps, redemptions, and liquidations—by enforcing stricter freshness guarantees where price accuracy is most vital.

- Stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI): must have timeouts ≤ 4 hours due to tight peg expectations.

- Major assets (e.g., ETH, WBTC): limited to 2 hours due to high volatility and liquidity.

- Minor or exotic assets: allowed up to 24 hours, balancing update frequency and availability.

```solidity
// Define reasonable timeout constants
uint256 constant STABLECOIN_MAX_TIMEOUT = 4 hours;
uint256 constant MAJOR_ASSET_MAX_TIMEOUT = 2 hours;  
uint256 constant MINOR_ASSET_MAX_TIMEOUT = 24 hours;

// Enhanced validation function
function initializeTokenOracle(
    address token,
    address dataSource,
    uint64 timeout,
    bool isStablecoin
) external {
    if (token == address(0)) revert NullAddress();
    if (dataSource == address(0)) revert NullAddress();
    
+   // Asset-specific timeout validation
+   uint256 maxTimeout;
+   if (isStablecoin) {
+       maxTimeout = STABLECOIN_MAX_TIMEOUT;
+   } else if (isMajorAsset[token]) {
+       maxTimeout = MAJOR_ASSET_MAX_TIMEOUT;
+   } else {
+       maxTimeout = MINOR_ASSET_MAX_TIMEOUT;
+   }

-   if (timeout == 0 || timeout > ONE_WEEK) revert InvalidTimeout();    
+   if (timeout == 0 || timeout > maxTimeout) revert InvalidTimeout();
    
    // ... rest of existing logic
}
