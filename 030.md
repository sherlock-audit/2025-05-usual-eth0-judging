# Missing `whenRedeemNotPaused` modifier in `redeemDao`

### Summary

`redeemDao()` can be called when redeems are paused

### Root Cause

The [`redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L541) function, enforces a `whenRedeemNotPaused` modifier.

The [`redemDao()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L564) function however, misses this modifier. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

Redeems are paused.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Not an attack, but the issue can happen as follows:
- Pauser pauses redeem for maintenance or for operational reasons.
- `redeemDao()` is called, disrupting the maintenance or the operational reason for which redemptions have been paused.

### Impact

According to `src/daoCollateral/README.md`: 
> - **isRedeemPaused:** Indicates whether the redeem functionality is currently paused. When this function returns true, users are unable to redeem ETH0 for LSTs, typically due to maintenance or other operational reasons.

So allowing DAO redemptions when redemptions are paused has the following impacts:
- Disrupts the maintenance or the operational reason for which redemptions have been paused.
- If redemption pause is triggered due to low collateral or system issues. DAO redemptions could exacerbate this, delaying recovery. 
- Discrepancy with `redeem()`.
- Contradiction with the README and therefore with the intended design, it's stated that users should be unable to redeem but that's not the case.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `whenRedeemNotPaused` to the `redeemDao()` function
