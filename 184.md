# Users cannot redeem if they get blacklisted after a swap

### Summary

Users need to be whitelisted in order for `ETH0` to be transferred, burned or minted from their accounts. However during redemption, the user's ETH0 need to be burnt from their account.. but if they get blcklisted after a swap, then they wont be able to achieve this leaving their funds stuck in the treasury exposing them to asset price fluctuations.

### Root Cause

During redemption, `ETH0` is burnt from the user in `_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral()` call

```sol
File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
538:     function redeem(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut) 

////SNIP
554:         uint256 returnedCollateral =
555:   @>        _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(collateralToken, amount, stableFee);

```

A look a the [`_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L481) function shows that we burn the ETH0 from the user

```sol
File: eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol
472:     function _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(

////SNIP
479:         uint256 burnedEth0 = eth0Amount - stableFee;
480:         // we burn all the ETH0 token
481:  @>     $.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount);


File: eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol
169:     function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public {

///SNIP
176:         _burn(account, amount);
177:     }


File: eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol
216:     function _update(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
217:         internal
218:         virtual
219:         override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable, ERC20Upgradeable)
220:     {
221:         Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
222:   @>    if ($.isBlacklisted[from] || $.isBlacklisted[to]) {
223:             revert Blacklisted();
224:         }
225:         super._update(from, to, amount);
226:     }

```

on L222 above, if the user is blacklisted, then they cant redeem their funds

### Internal Pre-conditions

User gets blacklisted

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- Alice swaps 100ETh for 100ETH0
- Alice get blacklisted
- Alice tries to redeem but cannot

### Impact

Thsi can lead to a DOS for some users further exposing them to price impact

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing blacklisted users to redeem the `ETH0` or implement a mechanism where blacklisted users can be forcefully redeemed by admin.
