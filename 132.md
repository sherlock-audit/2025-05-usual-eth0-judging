# User may experience failed swap due to silent permit failure

### Summary

A missing revert or notification on permit failure in `swapWithPermit` will cause a failed swap for users as the contract will proceed to call `swap` even if the `permit` signature is invalid or expired, resulting in a revert due to insufficient allowance.

### Root Cause

In [DaoCollateral.sol:swapWithPermit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L521-L535), the `permit` call is wrapped in a try-catch block that silently ignores all errors, allowing the function to proceed to `swap` even if the permit fails.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has not previously approved the contract to spend their collateral token.
2. User submits an invalid, expired, or otherwise incorrect permit signature to `swapWithPermit`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The collateral token implements EIP-2612 permit functionality.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `swapWithPermit` with an invalid or expired signature.
2. The `permit` call fails and is silently caught.
3. The contract proceeds to call `swap`, which attempts to transfer tokens without allowance.
4. The transfer fails, and the transaction reverts, but the user receives no clear indication that the permit was the cause.

### Impact

The user cannot mint ETH0 tokens using `swapWithPermit` if their permit is invalid, and receives no clear feedback about the failure. This can lead to confusion and poor user experience.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Revert the transaction if the permit call fails, or emit an event indicating permit failure to provide clear feedback to the user.
