# Inconsistent Fee Handling in redeem

### Issue Description

In the `redeem` function of the protocol, there is an inconsistency in how fees are handled when the Counter Bank Run (CBR) mechanism is active, indicated by `$.isCBROn` being `true`. Specifically, even when `$.isCBROn` is on, the function calculates the amount of collateral to return to the user—via the `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` function—using `burnedEth0`, which is derived by subtracting the `stableFee` from the `eth0Amount`. This behavior contradicts the intended design of the CBR mechanism, where no fee should be deducted during such conditions.
- Issue occurs at [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L479)

#### Current Behavior
- The `stableFee` is calculated based on the `eth0Amount` (the amount of ETH0 the user wishes to redeem).
- The `burnedEth0` is computed as `eth0Amount - stableFee`, regardless of whether `$.isCBROn` is `true` or `false`.
- The `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` function then uses this `burnedEth0` value to determine the collateral amount returned to the user.
- When `$.isCBROn` is `true`, no fee is minted to the treasury yield (which is correct), but the subtraction of `stableFee` from `eth0Amount` still occurs, leading to a reduced `burnedEth0` value and, consequently, less collateral returned to the user than intended.

#### Intended Behavior
- **When `$.isCBROn` is `true`:** No fee (`stableFee`) should be subtracted from the `eth0Amount`. The `burnedEth0` should equal the full `eth0Amount`, and the collateral returned via `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` should reflect this full amount.
- **When `$.isCBROn` is `false`:** The `stableFee` should be subtracted from `eth0Amount` to calculate `burnedEth0`, and the fee should be minted to the treasury yield as usual.

#### Example
Consider a user redeeming 100 ETH0 with a redeem fee of 1% (i.e., `stableFee = 1 ETH0`):
- **If `$.isCBROn` is `true`:**
  - Current behavior: `burnedEth0 = 100 - 1 = 99 ETH0`. The `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` uses 99 ETH0, so the user receives collateral equivalent to 99 ETH0.
  - Intended behavior: `burnedEth0 = 100 ETH0` (no subtraction), and the user receives collateral equivalent to 100 ETH0.
- **If `$.isCBROn` is `false`:**
  - `burnedEth0 = 100 - 1 = 99 ETH0`, and the fee (1 ETH0) is minted to the treasury yield, which is correct.

The bug causes users to receive less collateral than they should when CBR is active, undermining the purpose of the CBR mechanism, which is to prioritize the collateralization ratio by forfeiting fees.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, the `redeem` function should be modified to avoid subtracting the `stableFee` from the `eth0Amount` when `$.isCBROn` is `true`. Here’s how it can be corrected:

1. **Conditional Fee Calculation:**
   - Only calculate and subtract the `stableFee` if `$.isCBROn` is `false`.
   - When `$.isCBROn` is `true`, set `stableFee = 0` (or skip the subtraction entirely), ensuring `burnedEth0` equals `eth0Amount`.

2. **Correct Collateral Calculation:**
   - Use the resulting `burnedEth0` in the `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` function to determine the collateral amount, ensuring that when CBR is active, the full `eth0Amount` is considered.

#### Suggested Code Implementation
Here’s a simplified example of how the logic should be updated in Solidity:

```solidity
uint256 stableFee = 0;
if (!$.isCBROn) {
    stableFee = _calculateFee(eth0Amount, collateralToken); // Calculate fee only if CBR is off
}
uint256 burnedEth0 = eth0Amount - stableFee; // No subtraction when stableFee = 0
$.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount); // Burn the full eth0Amount
if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn) {
    $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee); // Mint fee only if CBR is off
}
uint256 returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(burnedEth0, collateralToken); // Use correct burnedEth0
```

#### Explanation of the Fix
- **When `$.isCBROn` is `true`:** `stableFee` remains 0, so `burnedEth0 = eth0Amount`. The `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` function uses the full `eth0Amount`, and no fee is minted.
- **When `$.isCBROn` is `false`:** `stableFee` is calculated and subtracted, `burnedEth0` reflects the reduced amount, and the fee is minted to the treasury yield.

This ensures that the collateral returned to the user is consistent with the CBR mechanism’s intent: no fee deduction when CBR is active, allowing users to receive the full collateral equivalent to their `eth0Amount`.
