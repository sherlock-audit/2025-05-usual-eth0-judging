# Blacklisted user(pauser/unpauser) can still pause and unpause the protocol which can lead to protocol DOS

### Summary

While doing manual review on `Eth0.sol`, I realized that there is insufficient validation for the `pause()` and `unpause()` functions despite the presense of `PAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE` and `UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE`  role restriction on both functions. This could lead to a major issue if a compromised user account with pauser (or unpauser) role has been blacklisted by the admin with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` (or Blacklist Operator `blacklistOperator` or any other role that can blacklist an account), with this vulnerability, that account can still perform critical actions that could harm the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `Eth0.sol`, there is a missing validation check to detect if the account calling pause/unpause functions are blacklisted.

```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc IEth0
    function pause() external {
@>//Missing check for blacklisted account
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(PAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE);
        _pause();
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IEth0
    function unpause() external {
@>//Missing check for blacklisted account
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE);
        _unpause();
    }

```

 If a compromised user account with pauser / unpauser role but has already been blacklisted by the admin, can still pause the protocol and this might lead to a potential DOS especially on the mainet.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An attacker/malicious user compromise the pauser/unpauser account.
2. Admin (e.g blacklistOperator) detect this and blacklist the account immediately. 


### External Pre-conditions

1. The compromised pauser account calls the pause() function (pause the protocol) without any restriction.

NB: This same goes for an unpauser account

### Attack Path

**The following is the assumed path:**

1. An attacker/malicious user compromise the pauser/unpauser account e.g through Private Key Exposure, Smart Contract Backdoors
2. Admin (e.g blacklistOperator) detect this and blacklist the account. 
3. The compromised pauser account calls the pause() function without any restriction thereby causing destruption of the protocol

### Impact

1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: A blacklisted pauser can pause the protocol permanently, locking user funds and halting all transfers.
2. **Censorship bypass:** Blacklisted unpauser can resume operations at will, defeating the purpose of the blacklist.
3. **Governance sabotage:** If roles are assigned via governance or multisig, a compromised or malicious actor could blacklist themselves to avoid scrutiny, yet retain full control.
4. **Compliance failures:** If the blacklist is intended to meet legal/AML obligations, allowing blacklisted actors to retain control can cause regulatory violations.


### PoC

```solidity
 function testPauseUnPause() external {
        allowlistAliceAndMintTokens();
        //blacklistOperator attempts to blacklist a malicious pauser user
        vm.startPrank(blacklistOperator);
        //pauser is successfully blacklisted
        eth0Token.blacklist(pauser);
        //pauser is confirmed to have been blacklisted
        vm.assertTrue(eth0Token.isBlacklisted(pauser));
        //unpauser is successfully blacklisted
        eth0Token.blacklist(unpauser);
        vm.stopPrank();
        //unpauser is confirmed to have been blacklisted
        vm.assertTrue(eth0Token.isBlacklisted(unpauser));

        //blacklisted pauser attempts to pause the protocol
        vm.prank(pauser);
        eth0Token.pause();
        //blacklisted pauser successfully paused the protocol
        vm.prank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(Pausable.EnforcedPause.selector));
        eth0Token.transfer(bob, 1e18);
        //blacklisted unpauser attempts to unpause the protocol
        vm.prank(unpauser);
        eth0Token.unpause();
        //blacklisted unpauser successfully paused the protocol
        vm.prank(alice);
        eth0Token.transfer(bob, 1e18);
    }


```

### Mitigation

In pause(), unpause(), add a modifier or internal check that prevents blacklisted accounts from performing any privileged actions.

```solidity 

modifier notBlacklisted() {
    require(!isBlacklisted(msg.sender), "Caller is blacklisted");
    _;
}

function pause() external notBlacklisted  {
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(PAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE);
        _pause();
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IEth0
    function unpause() external notBlacklisted {
        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(UNPAUSING_CONTRACTS_ROLE);
        _unpause();
    }

```
