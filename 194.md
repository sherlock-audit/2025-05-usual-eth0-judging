# Protocol assumes stEth is 1:1 to Eth

### Summary

Protocol mints ETH0 based on the eth value provided by the users' collateral tokens. Right now it only uses WstEth as collateral and the oracle used by the protocol only converts WstEth to stEth, assumes that is the Eth value provided by the user, however stEth will not always be 1:1 to Eth. There is also a bot which would pause the contract if price deviates extremely but this bot can be frontrun or if the price does not deviate too much users can still mint ETH0 while providing less value than needed.
This can break these invariants:
We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury.
ETH0 minting is not allowed if it is not backed by at least the same ETH amount of collateralTokens.

### Root Cause

`LidoWstEthOracle.sol:latestRoundData` returns `IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken()` as the answer, this only returns how many stEth, a WstEth token corresponds to, not how much Eth value a WstEth token has. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L86
This oracle is called by `ClassicalOracle.sol` which inherits from `AbstractOracle.sol`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L80
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/AbstractOracle.sol#L103-L106

`ClassicalOracle.sol` is then used by `ETH0.sol`, here in the mint function this will cause value of collateral backing in Eth to be wrong.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L149
`daoCollateral.sol` will also use the oracle to get Eth value from WstEth amount, and use it in redeem and swap operations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. stEth is cheaper than Eth

### Attack Path

1. User calls swap to get ETH0
2. Oracle reports WstEth value to be bigger than it is
3. Protocol mints more ETH0 than it should
Note that if the price is deviated too much, the bot that is responsible for pausing can be frontrun to still mint ETH0 with corrupted prices.

### Impact

Invariants pointed out above can be broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Collateral to Eth value conversion should also include stEth to Eth conversion.
