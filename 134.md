# Attacker will drain protocol collateral from users via oracle manipulation

### Summary

A lack of robust oracle protections will cause a loss of collateral for users as an attacker manipulates the oracle price of low liquidity collateral tokens to mint ETH0 and then redeem other collateral tokens at an unfair price.

### Root Cause

The choice to rely on a single or manipulable oracle source is a mistake as it allows an attacker to influence the price used for minting and redemption, leading to unfair value extraction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin sets or approves a collateral token that can be manipulated (e.g., a  low-liquidit token).
2. The protocol does not have sufficient checks for price sanity or oracle update frequency.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker is able to manipulate the oracle price (e.g., by trading on a low-liquidity collateral token, pushing a price feed, or controlling the data publisher).
2. The manipulated price is reflected in the protocol's oracle at the time of swapping.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker manipulates the oracle price for a collateral token to be artificially high.
2. Attacker calls `swap()` to mint ETH0 with less collateral than should be required, receiving excess ETH0.
3. Attacker calls `redeem()` to burn ETH0(redeeming for another collateral token) and receive more collateral than should be allowed.
4. The protocol loses collateral, and honest users are left with under-collateralized ETH0.


### Impact

The users and protocol suffer a loss of collateral value, potentially leading to insolvency. The attacker gains the difference between the manipulated and fair value of ETH0 or collateral.

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use decentralized, robust oracles (e.g., Chainlink).
