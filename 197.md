# Value of ETH0 might exceed the value of ETH inside the treasury leading to a broken invariant

### Summary

When calling [`swap(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L504-L518), users exchange an LST (i.e. wstETH) for ETH0. In order to perform the swap, the protocol uses an oracle to determine the value in ETH of the provided collateral. The value of the collateral (wstETH) is determined through the retrieved [`answer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L80) from the `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed` contract and it is the exchange rate of wstETH for stETH. The problem is that this fetched number is not furthermore converted into ETH by using an external oracle such as Chainlink, but rather it is assumed that stETH == ETH. However, if stETH < ETH (stETH is almost all the time worth slightly less than ETH) the value of newly minted ETH0 will be slightly less than ETH, meaning the following invariant will be broken - [`"We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury."`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0-chonkov?tab=readme-ov-file#q-what-propertiesinvariants-do-you-want-to-hold-even-if-breaking-them-has-a-lowunknown-impact).

### Root Cause

Inside the `ClassicalOracle`, the exchange rate of stETH for wstETH is fetched through the [`_latestRoundData(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L71-L90). The problem is that this is the price of stETH compared to wstETH and **NOT** the price of ETH. In order to get the correct value in ETH, the fetched "price" of stETH that was received as an "answer" from the oracle needs to be converted into ETH. This can happen by calling the [`latestRoundData(...)`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x86392dC19c0b719886221c78AB11eb8Cf5c52812#readContract#F10) on the Chainlink STETH / ETH price oracle. The current implementation just assumes that stETH == ETH and mints ETH0 equal to stETH and not ETH.

Example:
At the time of writing the price of wstETH is 3150 and that of stETH is 2600 (2602.30 to be precise). The exchange rate is slightly above 1.2e18 (Which is expected - 3150 / 2602.3 ~ 1.2). `ClassicalOracle` calls `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed` and gets that exact exchange rate, but if the price of ETH is worth more than that of stETH (which at the time of writing this issue is - The current prices of ETH and stETH are $2,606.82 and $2,602.30, which is a difference of roughly 0.2%.), then the swapper will receive more ETH0 than they are supposed to. Because ETH is worth more than stETH, the user should have gotten 1.2*0.998 ETH0 instead of 1.2. Clearly, the difference is minimal. However, not only it brakes an invariant since the value of ETH0 is worth more than the value of ETH currently sitting in the treasury, but those tiny differences can add up, since for the majority of the time, stETH is "at a discount" compared to ETH. Additionally, historically there have been times when stETH has been "considerably" cheaper (The price difference between the two has been more than 1%).

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

ETH needs to be more expensive compared to stETH, which is true most of the time.

### Attack Path

Here is the exact attack path, including all internal functions. For simplicity, let's assume the prices of wstETH, stETH and ETH are the following: 3120, 2600, 2605. The number of decimals all these tokens have is 18 and the prices provided by the `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed` feed are also with 18 decimals. Also, let's assume this is the first user called Bob.
1. We call [`swap(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L504-L518) as the first user. `collateralToken` is wstETH, `amount` is 1e18 and `minAmountOut` is 0.
2. The internal [`_swapCheckAndGetETHQuote(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L337-L360) is called. The parameters are wstETH and 1e18. All the checks are passed.
3. The internal [`_getQuoteInETH(uint256 tokenAmount, address collateralToken)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L398-L406) is called, where `tokenAmount` is 1e18 and `collateralToken` is wstETH.
4. It then calls the internal [`_getPriceAndDecimals(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L383-L391). This function is going to make the external call to the `ClassicalOracle` contract in order to fetch the exchange rate of wstETH (the collateral token) for ETH (**This is where the problem begins**).
5. The [`getPrice(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/AbstractOracle.sol#L103-L108) is called on the `ClassicalOracle`, which inherits from the `AbstractOracle`. `token` is once again wstETH.
6. The function calls the internal [`_latestRoundData(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L71-#L90).  The `decimals` variable is eq to 18, which is important since it will simplify some calculations later on. On [line 80](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L80), the function makes an external call to the `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed` feed in order to fetch the exchange rate of wstETH for stETH. Since wstETH and stETH are worth 3120 and 2600, the `answer` returned by the feed will be 1.2e18 (3120/2600 == 1.2). Both values (1.2e18 and 18) are returned.
7. We exit both the `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed::latestRoundData` and `ClassicalOracle::_latestRoundData` and go back into the `getPrice(...)`.
8. The `tokenAmountToWad(...)` is called but since the price reported by the feed is in 18 decimals, nothing really happens.
9. The `_checkDepegPrice(...)` is called, but since wstETH is **NOT** a stablecoin, the function returns [on line 138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/AbstractOracle.sol#L138).
10. We exit `getPrice(...)` and get back to `_getPriceAndDecimals(...)` inside the `DaoCollateral` contract.
11. We exit `_getPriceAndDecimals(...)` and return to `_getQuoteInETH(...)`. The returned `wadPriceInETH` and decimals are 1.2e18 and 18 respectively. Since decimals is eq to 18, the function on line 404 doesn't do anything and the calculation performed on line 405 is equal to: 1e18 * 1.2e18 / 1e18 rounded down or 1.2e18. This is the value returned to `_swapCheckAndGetETHQuote(...)`.
12. We go back to `_swapCheckAndGetETHQuote(...)` and `wadQuoteInETH` is equal to 1.2e18.
13. We exit the function and go back to swap, where [`wadQuoteInETH`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L510) is eq to 1.2e18.
14. We enter [`_transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 wadAmountInETH0)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L367-L377), where `collateralToken`, `amount` and `wadAmountInETH0` are wstETH, 1e18 and 1.2e18 respectively.
15. On line 374, 1 wstETH is transferred to the treasury and the `Eth0::mint(address to, uint256 amount)` is called.
16. `to` is `msg.sender` and `amount` is equal to `wadAmountInETH0` or 1.2e18. The cap is not exceeded since we are the first user.
17. We get to the [`for-loop`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L147-L161). Since initially there is just 1 collateral token - wstETH, we iterate once. The value of [`wadCollateralBackingInETH`]() is equal to `collateralTokenPriceInETH * wstETH. balanceOf(treasury) / (10 ** decimals)`, which is 1.2e18 * 1e18 / (10 ** 18) == **1.2e18**. Balance of treasury is 1e18 due to step 15. `collateralTokenPriceInETH` is 1.2e18, since `CONTRACT_ORACLE` inside the `RegistryContract` is the `ClassicalOracle` and the process from earlier will be repeated. The check [`on line 162`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L162) will be equal to - `0 + 1.2e18 > 1.2e18`, which is false.
18. Finally, the caller is minted 1.2e18 ETH0 and an event is emitted in `swap(...)`.

### Impact

In the case, when ETH is worth more than stETH (most of the time), the value of ETH0, which the user will receive, will be worth slightly more than the collateral they provided. In the rare cases, when stETH is worth more than ETH, the user will get less ETH0 than they are supposed to, since the value of the collateral will be worth more than their ETH0, which is good for the protocol, not good for the user. Only when stETH == ETH, everything is ok.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Once the exchange rate of wstETH for stETH is fetched from the `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed` contract, call the stETH/ETH Chainlink price feed - https://etherscan.io/address/0x86392dC19c0b719886221c78AB11eb8Cf5c52812#readContract#F10. When doing so, instead of minting 1.2e18 ETH0 just like in the example we looked at earlier, the user will get minted something like 1.998 ETH0, which is the correct amount.
