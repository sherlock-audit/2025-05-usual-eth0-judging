# Enabling CBR applies coefficient uniformly to all forms of collateral, defeating its core purpose.

### Summary

In the words of a protocol member, "CBR stands for Counter Bank Run mechanism. In the event of a depegged collateral it will disincentivize the redeem on one collateral against the others." However, when CBR is enabled the coefficient is applied to all forms of collateral when the redeem function is executed. The result is that the purpose of enabling CBR is not achieved: if it is enabled, all collateral will be affected and there will be no incentive and if it is left disabled then the bank run risk remains.

### Root Cause

The core of the issue is that CBR is applied generally, not to a specific collateral token and therefore cannot achieve its desired purpose. We this in the following:

[DaoCollateral.sol#L247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L247)
```javascript
function activateCBR(uint256 coefficient) external {
        // we should revert if the coef is greater than 1
        if (coefficient > SCALAR_ONE) {
            revert CBRIsTooHigh();
        } else if (coefficient == 0) {
            revert CBRIsNull();
        }
        _requireOnlyAdmin();
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        $.isCBROn = true;
        $._swapPaused = true;
        $.cbrCoef = coefficient;
        emit CBRActivated($.cbrCoef);
        emit SwapPaused();
    }
```

Notice that `$.isCBROn` and `$.cbrCoef` belong to DaoCollateral's storage, and have nothing to do with the TokenMapping contract, where there exist further mappings to specify collateral-specific data. The CBR storage variables are applied generally to all forms of collateral. As mentioned earlier, this is contrary to the purpose of CBR, which serves to disincentivize one form of collateral under the other in case it loses its peg.

Indeed, when `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH` is called (from `redeem`->`_burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral`), we see that the enabled CBR coefficient is applied regardless of the collateral token being transferred: 

```javascript
function _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(uint256 wadStableAmount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 amountInToken)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        amountInToken = _getQuoteInTokenFromETH(wadStableAmount, collateralToken);
        // if cbr is on we need to apply the coef to the collateral price
        // cbrCoef should be less than 1e18
        if ($.isCBROn) {
            amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        }
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. More than one form of collateral is used

### External Pre-conditions

1. Bank run risk exists

### Attack Path

1. Protocol uses more than one form of collateral (this is likely given "We are integrating wstETH as a first collateral and we expect future LST to also be accruing", in the docs and protocol design for multiple forms of collateral)
2. One form of collateral loses it's peg (example given by protocol team: Lido loses 10% of it's ETH)
3. Protocol enables CBR with a .9 coefficient
4. Now other forms of collateral are depegged. 

(Or if they don't enable CBR then redeem either remains paused indefinitely or wstETH remains depegged)

### Impact

Depending on the protocol's choice given the pre-conditions any of the following can occur:

1. [ENABLE CBR] Other forms of collateral are depegged internally and arbitrage opportunity can be exploited leading to huge losses for the protocol and users
2. [PAUSE SWAP/REDEEM] Indefinite DoS/shutdown of protocol for all users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enable CBR selectively by adding it as a mapping(address token => bool)
