# Price update intervals may be slightly greater than heartbeat

### Summary

The protocol oracle requires that prices are only valid during heartbeat intervals, however in practice price update intervals will be slightly larger than heartbeats, which makes the protocol unavailable during this period.

### Root Cause

In [ClassicalOracle.sol#L83-L88](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L83-L88), the protocol oracle requires that prices are only valid during heartbeat intervals.
```solidity
        // track the updatedAt value from  latestRoundData()
        // to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough for your application to use it
        // detects that the reported answer is not updated within the heartbeat timeout
        if (block.timestamp > $.tokenToOracleInfo[token].timeout + updatedAt) {
            revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
        }
```
however in practice price update intervals will be slightly larger than heartbeats.

For example, for the RETH/ETH oracle: https://etherscan.io/address/0x536218f9E9Eb48863970252233c8F271f554C2d0#readContract

updateAt == 1748992127 for roundID == 36893488147419103560

updateAt == 1749078539 for roundID == 36893488147419103561

1749078539-1748992127 == 86412, it's slightly greater than its heartbeat of 86400, note that this is often the case, which makes the protocol unavailable during the diffrence (12s).

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

It makes the protocol unavailable for a short period of time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add a slight timeout on the heartbeat
