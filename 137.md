# Mint Cap vs Collateral Race Condition Vulnerability

### Summary

Wrong order of validation checks in mint function will cause a permanent asset loss vulnerability for users as malicious actors will exploit the mint cap check occurring before collateral backing validation to trap user collateral in the treasury without minting corresponding ETH0 tokens.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L129C5-L166C6

### Root Cause

In Eth0.sol:mint(), the mint cap validation occurs before collateral backing calculation and validation, creating a window where user collateral can be transferred to the treasury but ETH0 minting fails due to insufficient backing that is only checked after the mint cap passes.

```solidty
// WRONG ORDER: Mint cap checked first
if (totalSupply() + amount > $.mintCap) {
    revert AmountExceedCap();
}

// collateral backing calculation...
for (uint256 i = 0; i < collateralTokens.length;) {
    // Multiple external calls and calculations
}

// Collateral backing checked second - can fail after collateral already transferred
if (totalSupply() + amount > wadCollateralBackingInETH) {
    revert AmountExceedBacking();
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call setMintCap() to set mintCap to be higher than the actual collateral backing available in the treasury
Treasury needs to contain insufficient collateral backing relative to the mint cap setting
DaoCollateral contract needs to have ETH0_MINT role to call the mint function
User needs to initiate a swap operation through DaoCollateral that would pass mint cap check but fail backing validation

### External Pre-conditions

Oracle price feeds need to be functioning to allow backing calculation to execute (failure modes exist but require oracle to work for calculation)
Treasury balance needs to be insufficient to back the new ETH0 tokens being minted
Network conditions need to allow collateral transfer to succeed but backing calculation to fail (e.g., gas limits, external call failures, oracle failure)

### Attack Path

Admin calls setMintCap(1000e18) setting mint cap higher than actual treasury backing (e.g., treasury only has 500 ETH worth of collateral)
User calls DaoCollateral.swap(wstETH, 100e18, minOut) to mint 100 ETH0 tokens by depositing 100 wstETH
DaoCollateral executes _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0() which first transfers user's 100 wstETH to treasury successfully
DaoCollateral calls ETH0.mint(user, 100e18) which begins validation process
Mint cap check passes as currentSupply + 100 <= 1000 (mint cap)
Backing calculation begins but determines treasury backing is insufficient (e.g., only 500 ETH backing for 600 ETH total supply)
Backing validation fails with AmountExceedBacking() revert
Transaction reverts but user's 100 wstETH remains permanently trapped in treasury with no ETH0 minted and no recovery mechanism

### Impact

The users suffer a 100% loss of their deposited collateral (wstETH) when backing validation fails after collateral transfer. The protocol gains over-collateralization at user expense, breaking the fundamental backing invariant by accumulating collateral without issuing corresponding ETH0 tokens.

### PoC

```solidity
// Test scenario demonstrating the vulnerability
function testMintCapRaceCondition() public {
    // Setup: Treasury has 500 wstETH backing, ETH0 supply is 500
    setupTreasuryWith500wstETH();
    
    // Admin sets mint cap higher than backing can support
    vm.prank(admin);
    eth0.setMintCap(1000e18); // Cap allows 1000 but only 500 backing exists
    
    // User attempts to mint 100 ETH0 with 100 wstETH
    uint256 userInitialBalance = 100e18;
    deal(address(wstETH), user, userInitialBalance);
    
    vm.startPrank(user);
    wstETH.approve(address(daoCollateral), userInitialBalance);
    
    // This will fail after transferring collateral
    vm.expectRevert("AmountExceedBacking");
    daoCollateral.swap(address(wstETH), userInitialBalance, 95e18);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // Verify user lost collateral but got no ETH0
    assertEq(wstETH.balanceOf(user), 0); // User lost wstETH
    assertEq(eth0.balanceOf(user), 0);   // User got no ETH0
    assertEq(wstETH.balanceOf(treasury), 600e18); // Treasury gained collateral
    assertEq(eth0.totalSupply(), 500e18); // No new ETH0 minted
    
    // No recovery mechanism exists
    assertTrue(noRecoveryFunctionExists());
}
```

### Mitigation

Reverse the order of validation checks in the mint() function to validate collateral backing before checking mint cap.
Additionally, implement an asset recovery mechanism for failed mints:
