# Attackers can sandwich oracle price updates to extract value from protocol

### Summary

An attacker can front-run the protocol and make a profit by front-running oracle price updates repeatedly.

### Root Cause

When redeeming ETH0 for collateral through `redeem` the amount of assets a user receives for burning a certain amount of ETH0 is determined by the asset price, which is retrieved using a Chainlink oracle:
```solidity
function _getPriceAndDecimals(address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        wadPriceInETH = uint256($.oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
        decimals = uint8(IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals());
    }
```
```solidity
function getPrice(address token) public view override returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 price, uint256 decimalsPrice) = _latestRoundData(token);
        price = price.tokenAmountToWad(uint8(decimalsPrice));
        _checkDepegPrice(token, price);
        return price;
    }
```
The problem arises due to the fact that an attacker can scan the mempool for oracle updates and front-run them. Here is how this can be used by an attacker to exploit the protocol:

- Scan the mempool for oracle updates.
- Identify an upcoming increase in price.
- Mint ETH0 at the current lower price before price is updated by calling `swap`.
- Redeem ETH0 for a higher collateral value directly after price is updated by calling `redeem`.
This exploit will always be profitable as long as the profit is more than the redeem fee. This is likely as the redeem fee is 0.1% according to the deploy [script](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/mock/constants.sol#L10) (`uint256 constant REDEEM_FEE = 10`), while a chainlink price feed can have a price deviation of 1% e.g, [USDC / ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/usdc-eth) has a deviation of 1% and [WSTETH / ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/optimism/mainnet/wsteth-eth) has a deviation of 0.5%. The oracle having a max deviation will still lead to a significant profit even after the redeem fee is removed. The profit can be compounded by an attacker taking a flashloan to mint a large amount of ETH0 before the price update and redeeming the collateral immediately after the oracle price is updated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Protocol must hold sufficient liquidity for swaps

### External Pre-conditions

Chainlink oracle must have a pending update transaction in mempool

### Attack Path

- Attacker monitors mempool for pending Chainlink price update transactions
- When spotting an update that will increase ETH price:
a. Mints ETH0 at the current lower price (e.g., 2600 USDC = 1 ETH)
- Allows price update transaction to execute (new price: 2620 USDC = 1 ETH)
- Immediately redeems ETH0 for a higher collateral at new higher price (1 ETH → 2620 USDC)
- Profit = (2620 - 2600) - (2620 × 0.001) = 20 - 2.62 = 17.38 USDC
- Repeats during volatile market conditions

### Impact

The protocol suffers financial losses repeatedly

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a time delay between minting and redemption or ensure the redeem fee is large enough to discourage the exploit
