# ETH0 System Fails to Account for WSTETH Rebalancing

### Summary

The ETH0 minting/redeeming mechanism fails to account for the dynamic rebalancing nature of WSTETH, leading to value leakage for users and protocol insolvency risk under edge cases. Unlike static assets, WSTETH accrues staking rewards (positive rebalancing) and is theoretically exposed to validator slashing (negative rebalancing). However, the protocol treats it as a fixed-value asset, using instantaneous pricing without adjustments for future changes. This oversight creates two critical failure modes:

Staking rewards are not fairly distributed – Users lose a portion of their expected yield when redeeming ETH0, as the system does not track accrued value over time.

Extreme slashing could drain the treasury – While statistically unlikely, any minute decrease in price could allow a user to drain the treasury 



### Root Cause

Instantaneous Pricing Without Rebalancing Adjustment

The protocol relies on the current WSTETH/ETH exchange rate ( sourced from the WSTETH contract ) to determine minting and redemption values. However, this approach is fundamentally incompatible with rebalancing tokens 


### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

steth rebalances as expected 

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Staking Reward Leakage (Expected Case)
User deposits 1 WSTETH when 1 WSTETH = 1.1 ETH.
They receive 1.1 ETH0.
Over time, staking rewards increase WSTETH’s value to 1.2 ETH.
When redeeming, they receive:
1.1 ETH0 / 1.2 = 0.916  WSTETH
Result: While users wsteth is akin to the eth value when they first deposited, they lose staking rewards accrued in that time 

Scenerio 2
Treasury holds 1,000 WSTETH as collateral backing all eth0 debt .
An attacker deposits 11,087 WSTETH before a slashing event is recorded in lido.
Slashing occurs, reducing WSTETH’s price from 1.1 ETH to 1.009 ETH.
Attacker redeems their ETH0, receiving:
11087 × 1.1 / 1.009 ≈12,088 WSTETH
Result: They extract 1,000 WSTETH from the treasury, effectively stealing the protocol’s reserves.




### Impact

1.ETH0 holders lose all staking rewards for wsteth deposited to the treasury 
2. potential complete draining of the treasury if the price goes down (possible due to slashing)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

track the price across the tokens for every address holding eth0 and update before every transfer 

1. Rebase-Adjusted ETH0 Balances (Preferred Solution)
Modify ETH0 to track WSTETH’s rebasing changes, ensuring balances grow with staking rewards.
