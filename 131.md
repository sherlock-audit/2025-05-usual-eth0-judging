# Griefing Attack Possible in swapWithPermit Through Front-Running and Silent Permit Failure


### Griefing Attack Possible in swapWithPermit Through Front-Running and Silent Permit Failure

**Description:** 
The `DaoCollateral::swapWithPermit` implements a try-catch block that silently ignores permit failures. This, combined with the ability to front-run transactions, allows malicious actors to grief users by forcing their transactions to fail, wasting their gas.

```solidity
try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
    msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
@> ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);
```

**Impact:** 
- Gas Theft: Users can be forced to waste gas on transactions that are guaranteed to fail
- Transaction Denial: Malicious actors can prevent users from executing their swaps
- Mempool Manipulation: Attackers can monitor and interfere with pending transactions
- Economic Impact: While no direct fund loss, users lose gas fees on failed transactions
- User Experience: Users may abandon the protocol due to failed transactions

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// Victim's transaction in mempool
daoCollateral.swapWithPermit(
    token,
    1000,
    minAmountOut,
    deadline,
    v, r, s
);

// Attacker's front-running transaction
token.approve(address(daoCollateral), 0);  // Reset allowance to 0

// Victim's transaction executes
// 1. Permit fails silently due to zero allowance
// 2. swap() is called
// 3. Transaction fails due to insufficient allowance
// 4. Victim loses gas
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- Explicit Permit Failure Handling
- Allowance Check Before Permit
