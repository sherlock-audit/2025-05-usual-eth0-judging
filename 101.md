# redeemDao lack of slippage protection

### Summary

There is no slippage protection in the `redeemDao` function that could lead to have less collateral than expected.

### Root Cause

In the redeemDAO there is no slippage protection as we can see here :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L564-L568

Since the redeem amount depend on the price of the collateral any fluctuation can affect the returned amount. 

Moreover if the CBR is on the amount of collateral returned will be decreased by a coefficient as we can see here L-439: 
```solidity
  if ($.isCBROn) {
            amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        }
```
Which could also affect the returned amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The DAO want to redeem an get less collateral than expected.

### Impact

The DAO will have less collateral than expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should add a slippage protection.
