# Protocol assumes that stETH price is  same as ETH.

### Summary

Protocol aims to peg, to the price of ETH while this is not what protocol implementation tries to do, as in current implementation protocol tries to peg to the price of stETH not ETH.

### Root Cause

Currently, to convert the wstETH to stETH, the protocol is using the, Classical oracle which works with the LidoWstEthOracle, and LidoWstEthOracle try to get the exchange rate of wstETH to stETH from `wstETH` contract and that `wstETH` amount is converted to `stETH` and that amount of EHT0 is minted to users. If we look at the function `_getQuoteInETH` , this function converts wstETH amount to ETH amount and that amount of ETH0 is minted to the user.
```solidity
    function _getQuoteInETH(uint256 tokenAmount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 wadAmountInETH)
    {
        (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals) = _getPriceAndDecimals(collateralToken);
        uint256 wadAmount = tokenAmount.tokenAmountToWad(decimals);
        wadAmountInETH = Math.mulDiv(wadAmount, wadPriceInETH, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }
```

The problem here is it mints according to the amount of stETH amount , not the ETH amount, so this will peg the ETH0 token with stETH not ETH.

As according to the documentation, there it has mention that prices will be monitored using the chainlink and in case of high deviation or hack the minting will get paused.

It can be said that in cases of extreme deviation or a hack, the chainlink pause system would respond accordingly. However, if we examine the [stETH/ETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-staked-ether/eth) price chart, we see that deviations of more than 3–4% are quite common during periods of high market volatility — a normal occurrence in the crypto market. 

This is breaking the core functionality of the protocol as the protocol pegs to stETH price not ETH.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. `stETH` price deviates from `ETH` price

### Attack Path

* During minting the price of stETH deviates from the price of ETH, and user minted ETH0 token with the price of stETH, hence this will  breaking the core functionality as the protocol states that ETH0 is pegged with ETH price.

### Impact

* Breaking the core functionality of the protocol, EHT0 price will not pegged to ETH price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use an oracle-based ETH price feed and implement a system like TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) to obtain a more accurate and stable price. This ensures that ETH0 is minted using a reliable price reference, helping it maintain a consistent peg to ETH.
