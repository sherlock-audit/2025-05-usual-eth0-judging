# The protocol assumes 1stETH = 1ETH

### Summary

The incorrect design of the `LidoWstEthOracle` will cause over-minting of ETH0 for users, because the oracle converts wstETH to stETH instead of wstETH to ETH. It assumes that 1 stETH will always be 1 ETH

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L86

The choice to use `IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken()` as the oracle rate is a mistake as it only returns the wstETH-to-stETH rate, not the wstETH-to-ETH rate. This misrepresents the true underlying ETH value and results in ETH0 being over-minted relative to the treasury collateral.

Currently 1stETH = 0.99911164ETH

Just a note that the off-chain bot will not pause the contract because this is not an extreme depeg

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions as it always happens

### External Pre-conditions

In order for this to be a problem the conversion stETH/ETH should not be 1:1 which is almost always the case

### Attack Path

1. User wants to swap 1 wstETH to mint ETH0.

2. Oracle reports stEthPerToken() = 1.2046 (wstETH-to-stETH).

3. Protocol mints 1.2046 ETH0 to the user.

4. However, the real value of 1 wstETH is only ~1.2023568 ETH.

5. Result: 0.0022432 ETH0 minted out of thin air per wstETH.

All of these values are real values at the time of writing the report. The user gets more ETH0 than the ETH value that he deposited into the treasury

### Impact

The protocol suffers a systemic collateralization bug, where the total supply of ETH0 is greater than the actual ETH collateral.
This breaks the core invariant of the stablecoin and allows users to repeatedly extract value by minting ETH0 at an inflated rate.
The attacker gains ETH0 which is backed by less ETH than claimed, threatening the solvency and peg of the protocol.

The more swaps are done the worse the issue gets. It breaks the key invariant that the protocol specified in the ReadMe:
> We can't have more ETH0 than the corresponding ETH value inside our treasury.
