# users will lose small amount of collateral tokens when they return collateral

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L488-L492

`tokenAmount = (ethAmount * 10^decimals) / price`
users are using above functions to get collateral back. but in this case, when price is too expensive, `collateralToken.decimals()` is too small, then the result of this division can floor to 0.
example: `returnedCollateral = (1 * 10^6) / 10^18 = 0.000000001 → floors to 0`
then any attempt to redeem small ETH0 amounts could revert — permanently locking them.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L488-L492
The minimum amount of collateral token or ETH0 required for redemption should be defined

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

no need

### Impact

- If a user has a small ETH0 balance or price of collateral token is too expensive that cannot reach returnedCollateral >= 1, they can never redeem it.
- Over time, small residual balances across many users become permanently inaccessible.
- This becomes a UX issue as well as a protocol dust accumulation issue.



### PoC

no need

### Mitigation

a minimum redeemable threshold per collateral is needed
`if (returnedCollateral < MIN_COLLATERAL_AMOUNT) {
    revert AmountTooLow();
}`
