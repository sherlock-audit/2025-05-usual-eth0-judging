# Manipulation of Oracle Data in _getPriceAndDecimals

### Summary

The _getPriceAndDecimals function relies on an oracle to fetch token prices without verifying the freshness of the data. If the oracle provides outdated or manipulated data, this can result in incorrect price calculations for the swap and redeem functions, leading to financial loss for users or the contract.



### Root Cause

The contract assumes that the oracle always provides accurate and up-to-date data. There is no mechanism to validate the timestamp of the data retrieved from the oracle, leaving the system vulnerable to stale or malicious price feeds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract interacts with an oracle to fetch token prices using the getPrice function.

No validation of the timestamp of the fetched data is performed in the _getPriceAndDecimals function.



### External Pre-conditions

The oracle is compromised, manipulated, or suffers from downtime, providing stale or inaccurate data.

Attackers or market changes cause the oracle to return values inconsistent with the current market state.



### Attack Path

Stale Data Exploitation:

The oracle provides a price that is significantly outdated.

A user performs a swap or redeem operation using the outdated price, gaining an unfair advantage.

Price Manipulation:

The attacker gains control over the oracle or its data sources.

The manipulated price is used by the contract, allowing the attacker to profit from incorrect calculations.

DoS Attack on Oracle Updates:

An attacker prevents the oracle from updating its data (e.g., through a DoS attack).

The contract continues to use stale data, enabling predictable manipulation.

### Impact

Financial Loss: Users or the contract may lose funds due to incorrect price calculations.

Market Manipulation: Exploiting stale or manipulated prices could disrupt the intended economic balance of the system.

Loss of Trust: Users may lose confidence in the system if price inaccuracies become apparent.

### PoC

Assume the oracle is returning a stale price of $50 for a token, while the market price is $100:

The user calls the redeem function, burning $50 worth of tokens to redeem an asset worth $100.

The contract calculates the returned collateral based on the stale $50 price, allowing the user to exploit the difference.

### Mitigation

Solution 1: Validate Data Freshness
Add a check in _getPriceAndDecimals to ensure that the oracle's data is recent:

```solidity
function _getPriceAndDecimals(address collateralToken)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals)
{
    DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
    wadPriceInETH = uint256($.oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
    uint256 updatedAt = uint256($.oracle.getTimestamp(collateralToken));
    require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= TIMEOUT, "Oracle data too old");
    decimals = uint8(IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals());
}
```
Solution 2: Implement Fallback Mechanisms
If the oracle data is stale, the contract should reject the transaction or switch to a backup oracle.

Solution 3: Use Multiple Oracles
Aggregate data from multiple oracles to reduce the risk of reliance on a single source.

Solution 4: Add Administrative Controls
Introduce functions to pause or adjust contract operations in case of oracle failure:


```solidity
function emergencyPause() external onlyAdmin {
    _pause();
}
```
