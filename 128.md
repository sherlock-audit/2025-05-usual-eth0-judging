# Slippage Protection Bypass: Users Can Swap at Unfavorable Rates by Setting minAmountOut = 0

## Description
The issue lies  in the function swap,  a user can the swap function with minAmountOut = 0, since the function does not check if minAmountOut is non-zero, so it proceeds with the swap if wadQuoteInETH > 0, which is always true since _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote ensures wadQuoteInETH > 0, bypassing slippage protection, potentially allowing a swap at an unfavorable rate

The swap function allows users to specify a minAmountOut, which is intended to act as slippage protection—i.e., to prevent swaps from proceeding if the output is less than a user-defined acceptable threshold.

However, the function does not validate that minAmountOut is greater than zero. This means a user could call the function with minAmountOut = 0, and since the internal quote function _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote() always returns wadQuoteInETH > 0, the condition:

```solidity
if (wadQuoteInETH < minAmountOut) {
    revert AmountTooLow();
}
```
will never trigger, allowing the swap to go through regardless of how unfavorable the rate is.

## Proof of Concept
Put the test in DaoCollateral.t.sol
```solidity
function test_Swap_AllowsMinAmountOutZero_BypassesSlippageProtection() public {
    // Setup: create a mock RWA token with 6 decimals and mint to alice
    (RwaMock token, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1_withMint(6, 100e6);
    address collateralToken = address(token);

    // Set an artificially low oracle price to simulate a bad rate
    uint256 badPrice = 1; // 1 wei (much less than 1e18)
    _setOraclePrice(collateralToken, badPrice);

    // Alice approves and swaps with minAmountOut = 0
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    token.approve(address(daoCollateral), 100e6);

    // The swap will succeed even though the output is extremely low, proving minAmountOut = 0 disables slippage protection
    daoCollateral.swap(collateralToken, 100e6, 0);

    // The actual ETH0 received is much less than what would be expected at a fair price
    uint256 actualOut = stbc.balanceOf(alice);
    assertGt(actualOut, 0, "Should mint some ETH0");
    assertLt(actualOut, 100e18, "Should mint much less than fair value due to bad price");

    vm.stopPrank();
}

function test_SwapWithPermit_AllowsExpiredOrReusedSignature() public {
    // Setup: create a mock RWA token with 6 decimals and mint to alice
    (RwaMock token, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1_withMint(6, 100e6);
    address collateralToken = address(token);

    // Prepare a permit signature with a deadline in the past
    uint256 expiredDeadline = block.timestamp - 1 days;
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = _getSelfPermitData(
        address(token), alice, alicePrivKey, address(daoCollateral), 100e6, expiredDeadline
    );

    // Alice has not approved daoCollateral yet
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    token.approve(address(daoCollateral), 0);

    // Call swapWithPermit with expired deadline
    // The function does not check deadline before calling permit, so permit will fail silently,
    // but swap will still proceed if Alice has enough allowance (which she doesn't here)
    // So, let's first approve, then try to reuse the signature
    vm.expectRevert(
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            IERC20Errors.ERC20InsufficientAllowance.selector, address(daoCollateral), 0, 100e6
        )
    );
    daoCollateral.swapWithPermit(address(token), 100e6, 0, expiredDeadline, v, r, s);

    // Now, approve manually and try to reuse the same signature (replay attack)
    token.approve(address(daoCollateral), 100e6);
    // The contract does not check if the signature is expired or reused, so swap will succeed
    daoCollateral.swapWithPermit(address(token), 100e6, 0, expiredDeadline, v, r, s);

    // Alice receives ETH0 even though the signature was expired/reused
    assertGt(stbc.balanceOf(alice), 0, "Swap succeeded with expired/reused permit signature");

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 10.24s (1.05s CPU time)

## Recommendation
Add a validation at the beginning of the function to ensure minAmountOut is non-zero:
```solidity
if (minAmountOut == 0) {
    revert InvalidMinAmountOut(); // or use a suitable custom error
}
```
