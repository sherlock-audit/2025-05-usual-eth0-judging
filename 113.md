# Inconsistent Economic Incentives During CBR Activation

## Finding description and impact

### Root Cause

The contract implements contradictory economic policies when the Collateral Backup Ratio (CBR) is activated versus deactivated, creating a double penalty mechanism that undermines system stability during critical periods.

**When CBR is ON:**
- Users receive reduced collateral through the coefficient penalty: `amountInToken = Math.mulDiv(amountInToken, $.cbrCoef, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor)`
- Fees are completely burned/forfeited: `if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn)` condition fails, so no fee minting occurs

**When CBR is OFF:**
- Users receive full collateral amounts (no coefficient applied)
- Fees are minted to treasury yield: `$.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee)`

### Impact 
1. **Perverse Incentive Structure**: The system punishes users most severely when collateralization is stressed (CBR active), potentially triggering bank run scenarios when system stability is most crucial.

2. **Compounding Penalties**: Users face dual punishment during CBR periods:
   - Reduced collateral returns (direct financial loss)
   - Complete fee forfeiture (no yield generation)

3. **Protocol Revenue Loss**: During periods when additional treasury funds would be most beneficial for system health, fee revenue is eliminated entirely.

4. **User Flight Risk**: Rational users will avoid interacting with the protocol when CBR is active, reducing liquidity and potentially accelerating collateralization crises.

## Mitigation

#### Enhanced CBR Fee Strategy
```solidity
// Implement differentiated fee handling that strengthens the system during CBR
if (stableFee > 0) {
    if ($.isCBROn) {
        // During CBR, allocate fees to stability fund or increase allocation
        $.eth0.mint($.stabilityReserve, stableFee);
    } else {
        // Normal operations - regular treasury allocation
        $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee);
    }
}
```
