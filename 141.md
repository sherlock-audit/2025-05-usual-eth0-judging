# User / owner of ETH0 unfairly loses a lot of value when `redeeming`

### Summary

The `DAOCollateral` contract unfairly transfers users / depositors a much smaller amount of `wstETH`( and its value in ETH) than they deserve to receive when they decide to  `redeem`. User will end in a loss, and the fee is not the issue, the user will lose a lot of value that is not associated with the fee they pay for redeeming. 

The vulnerability is present and will persist with each `redeem` when `wstETH` becomes stronger, as it is a yield generating token which means it accrues value) - the protocol also acknowledges this possibility in the contest page:

"In case of protocol surplus(i.e because the price of wstETH would be accruing over time) if eth0.mintCap would block the minting of new ETH0 we will raise the mint cap. "

This report will walk through the flow of the `redeem` process, and show how the user ends in an unfair loss.

### Root Cause

The inconsistent handling of the relationship of the exchange rate between:
- ETH0
- ETH
- wstETH (collateral)

Will lead to user losses whenever wstETH generates yield and increases in value. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. No internal pre-conditions 

### External Pre-conditions

1. wstETH accrues value and increases its ETH value, making wstETH stronger.

### Attack Path

1. The user deposits 13 `wstETH` at a current exchange rate of wstETH / ETH of 1:1 -> so the user is minted 13 `ETH0`
2. `wstETH` accrues in value over time and is now worth `1.2 ETH` per `wstETH` -> exchange rate of wstETH / ETH of 1 : `1.2`

** At this point, the user has:  `13 ETH0`
** The initially deposited 13 `wstETH` now has a value of `15.6` ETH : ( 13 * 1.2 )  

1. The user calls `redeem` : and attempts to redeem all `13` of their `ETH0` for wstETH

** The following is a step by step flow after user calls `redeem` 

1. `_calculateFee` will take a percentage of the `ETH0` amount used for redeem. For this report lets say the fee is `20%` (the max fee allowed is 25% , so this is within reason of the protocol limits). The fee will be `2 ETH0`. (It is 2.6 but protocol rounds down to 2)

```solidity
    function _calculateFee(uint256 eth0Amount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 stableFee)
    {
        stableFee = Math.mulDiv(eth0Amount, $.redeemFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
```

2. `burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral` 

```solidity
  function _burnEth0TokenAndTransferCollateral(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 eth0Amount,
        uint256 stableFee
    ) internal returns (uint256 returnedCollateral) {
        uint256 burnedEth0 = eth0Amount - stableFee;
        // we burn all the ETH0 token
->        $.eth0.burnFrom(msg.sender, eth0Amount);

        if (stableFee > 0 && !$.isCBROn) {
->            $.eth0.mint($.treasuryYield, stableFee);
        }
->        returnedCollateral = _getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(burnedEth0, collateralToken);
```

** At this point, all 13 ETH0 are burned from the user, and 2 ETH0 (fee) are minted to the treasuryYield 

3. `_getTokenAmountForAmountInETH(burnedEth0, collateralToken);` : burnedEth0 is 11 
** The flow of this function is as follows: 

3a. gets price of collateral in ETH : will use the oracle to get the collateral token price IN ETH. and returns the price of wstETH IN ETH.

```solidity
    /// @dev call the oracle to get the price in ETH
    /// @return decimals number of decimals of the token
    function _getPriceAndDecimals(address collateralToken)
```

3b. `getQuoteInTokenFromEth` uses the price returned above to calculate the amount of `wstETH` to transfer to user: `wadStableAmount` is 11 ETH0

```solidity
    function _getQuoteInTokenFromETH(uint256 wadStableAmount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 amountInToken)
    {
        (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals) = _getPriceAndDecimals(collateralToken);
        // will result in an amount with the same 'decimals' as the token
->        amountInToken = wadStableAmount.wadTokenAmountForPrice(wadPriceInETH, decimals);
```

3c. `wadTokenAmountForPrice` is called in the `normalize` contract to calculate the `wstETH` amount to transfer to user based on the price and the ETH0 amount being redeemed. (wadStableAmount = 11 eth0 , wadPriceInEth = 1.2)

```solidity
    function wadTokenAmountForPrice(uint256 wadStableAmount, uint256 wadPrice, uint8 tokenDecimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return Math.mulDiv(wadStableAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals, wadPrice, Math.Rounding.Floor);
```

** This function will determine that for the 11 ETH0 the user is redeeming for `wstETH` , which is at a price of `1.2 ETH` -> the user will receive `9.166` `wstETh` , which it explictly rounds down to `9`.  11 / 1.2 = 9.16 , rounded down to 9

** THIS IS THE ISSUE: The protocol assumes that because it aims to have an `eth0 : eth` exchange ratio of `1:1` that it is fair to calculate the amount of wstETH to redeem based on the ETH0 amount (as it treats the 11 ETH0 as 11 ETH).  So the calculation uses the 11 `ETH0` as if it was `11 ETH` in which, since wstETH got stronger, 9.16 wstETH is calculated because that would amount to 11 ETH. But the discrepancy of the exhcange ratios makes this untrue - wstETH / eth is now 1 : 1.2.

** The protocol here treats the 11 ETH0 as if it is 11 ETH being redeemed because it enforces 1 :1 ratio between the two, so the user is forced to receive an amount of wstETH based off of a WEAKER ETH value relative to wstETH. 

That amount is then transferred to the user at the end of `redeem`. The 9 `collateralToken` (wstETH) is sent to the user. 

```solidity
      // we distribute the collateral token from the treasury to the user
        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-erc20
        IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).safeTransferFrom($.treasury, msg.sender, returnedCollateral);
```

** The 9 wstETH that the user receives is worth 10.8 ETH (9 wstETH at the price of 1 : 1.2 eth) 

With the ending balance of wstETH sent to the user now known, lets look at the unfair amount of wstETH and value of ETH the user receives:

1. User started with:
- Depositing 13 wstETH - worth 13 ETH
- 13 ETH0 - worth 13 ETH

2. User ends with:

- ALL 13 ETH0 burned, therefore they have no more claim to any funds from the protocol for redemption
- based on the design, which is ok, user forfeits 2 ETH0 to pay for the fee. So they receive wstETH equivalent of 11 ETH0 
- Based on the protocol currently, and how to treats the relationship of ETH0 to ETH and the collateral token, the user receives 9 wstETH
- **### The ETH value of the 9 wstETH is 10.8 ETH**

The problem is that the protocol says ETH0 remains a 1:1 relationship with ETH, but this is not dynamically accurate for the collateral wstETH. The exchangeRate of wstETH changed from 1:1 eth - to 1 : 1.2 eth . While the exchange rate for wstETH to ETH0 remained unchanged at 1 : 1. So all of the value of wstETH is lost by the user in the deviation of the exchange rate with ETH. if ETH0 was 1 : 1 with ETH , than when wstETH increases to 1 : 1.2 ETH , wstETH would also increase to 1 : 1.2 ETH0. 

In this scenario, the user would have redeemed 13 ETH0 (they initially deposited 13 wstETH) 
Payed the 2 ETH0 fee (worth 1.667 wstETH) 
**### And received 13.2 ETH worth of wstETH   ->  11 ETH0 at price of wstEth / ETH0 of 1 : 1.2** 

 **The user loses the difference (13.2 worth of eth - 10.8 worth of eth) = 2.4 ETH** 

** User's initial 13 wstETH deposited at the time of redemption is worth 15.6 ETH. Even with the fee of 2 ETH0 (which doesnt account for wstETH / ETH price, it assumes a 1 : 1 eth relationship) the user should have a remaining ETH value equivalent of wstETH of 13.2 - but they only receive an ETH value equivalent of wstETH of 10.8. This is unfair and the user sustains losses. 




### Impact

The user loses ETH value whenever they redeem ETH0 for wstETH whenever wstETH generates yield and increases in value vs ETH. 

The user forfeits any future gain in value of wstETH when they deposit for ETH0.

This completely disincentivizes users from depositing wstETh for ETH0 - because they will forfeit any yield generation from holding wstETH and instead they will pass the yield gain to the protocol. 

In addition to the fee paid, the user pays the loss of any gain that wstETH has. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Because the protocol is using wstETH as collateral, and acknowledges that it is a yield generating token, there has to be a mechanism to account for the increase in price of wstETH against ETH. And this needs to be attributed to the relationship of ETH0 to wstETH , as ETH0 is enforced to be 1 : 1 with ETH -> but it never adjusts for wstETH.
