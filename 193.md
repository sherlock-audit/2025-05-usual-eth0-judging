# No Mechanism to Remove Deprecated Collateral Tokens

### Summary

The TokenMapping contract only provides functionality to add collateral tokens via [addEth0CollateralToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/TokenMapping.sol#L78) but lacks any mechanism to remove or deprecate them. Once added, collateral tokens remain permanently in the system and continue to be included in backing calculations, creating security and operational risks if tokens become compromised or need deprecation.

### Root Cause

The TokenMapping contract design is incomplete, providing only unidirectional token management (addition) without implementing corresponding removal or deprecation functionality for collateral tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Admin needs to call addEth0CollateralToken() to add a collateral token to the protocol
- Token needs to be successfully added and become part of the backing calculations
- Protocol needs to continue operating with the added token included in all relevant computations

### External Pre-conditions

- Collateral token needs to become compromised, paused, or experience security vulnerabilities
- Token issuer needs to deprecate or sunset the token
- Regulatory changes need to require removal of specific tokens from the protocol
- Token needs to experience significant depegging or loss of backing value

### Attack Path

1. Admin adds a collateral token to the protocol using addEth0CollateralToken()
2. Token becomes integrated into the protocol's backing calculations and minting operations
3. External factors cause the token to become problematic (compromised, paused, deprecated, or loses backing)
4. Protocol continues to treat the problematic token as valid collateral in backing calculations
5. Users can potentially exploit the compromised token's inclusion in backing calculations
6. Minting operations may fail or produce incorrect results due to the deprecated token's continued presence
7. Protocol experiences operational disruption or security risks as there's no way to remove the problematic token from the system

### Impact

Problematic collateral tokens cannot be removed from the system, potentially causing issues with minting operations if deprecated tokens are included in backing calculations. This could lead to protocol disruption or security risks if compromised tokens remain active in the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a removeEth0CollateralToken() function that allows admin users to deprecate collateral tokens. Consider implementing a soft removal that marks tokens as inactive rather than completely removing them to maintain historical data integrity.
