# Oracle Initialization Missing Future Timestamp Validation

## Finding description and impact

The `initializeTokenOracle` function confirms that the oracleâ€™s data meets three conditions: `answer > 0`, `updatedAt != 0`, and `block.timestamp <= updatedAt + timeout`. However, it **fails to verify** that `updatedAt` is not a future timestamp. As a result, an oracle could supply a price update dated ahead of the current block time and still pass validation.

**Code snippet:**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol#L45-L68

### Impact

* Accepting a future `updatedAt` may lead to incorrect assumptions about the age of the price data.
* This loophole can be exploited to force the protocol to use manipulated or stale prices.
* Future timestamps could break timeout logic in functions that depend on `updatedAt` for freshness checks.

## Mitigation

Add a validation step to reject any oracle update that claims to be from the future:

```solidity
if (updatedAt > block.timestamp) {
    revert OracleNotWorkingNotCurrent();
}
```

This ensures that only price data with timestamps at or before the current block time are accepted.
