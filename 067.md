# Lack of deadline on Swap and Redemption can cause outdated slippage

### Summary


The [swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L504-L510) and redeem function in the ETH0 protocol does not enforce a deadline on [redemptions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L538-L547), exposing users to price slippage risk if their transaction remains pending in the mempool for too long. Since the minAmountOut check occurs at execution time, significant price changes between transaction submission and mining can cause the redemption to revert, even though the parameters were valid when signed.

### Root Cause

The current implementation lacks a time-based validity check for redemptions. The only safeguard is minAmountOut, which does not prevent stale transactions from executing under changed market conditions.

```solidity
if (returnedCollateral < minAmountOut) {
    revert AmountTooLow();
}
```

or in swap 
```solidity
        if (wadQuoteInETH < minAmountOut) {
            revert AmountTooLow();
        }
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

Nil

### External Pre-conditions

1. Transaction pends for a while
2. Price moves during this period

### Attack Path

1. Redemption Reverts Due to Slippage
User redeems 1000 ETH0 expecting 1 ETH0 = 1 USDC, sets minAmountOut = 950 USDC.

Before the tx is mined, price moves: 1 USDC = 1.1 ETH0.

Redemption now yields ~900 USDC → transaction reverts with AmountTooLow.

2. Redemption Reverts Due to Price Movement in the Other Direction
Initially: 1 ETH = 0.9 USDC
User redeems 1000 ETH0, expecting ~1110 USDC, and sets minAmountOut = 1100.

Before the tx is mined, price moves to 1 ETH = 1 USDC.
Now 1000 ETH0 yields 1000 USDC → transaction reverts due to slippage.

3. Revert from Treasury Insufficiency
Treasury holds 1000 USDC.
User tries to redeem 1000 ETH0 when the price is 1 USDC = 1 ETH0. setting slippage at 1000 usdc
Now before the transaction is mined, price moves to 1 USDC = 0.9ETH0 
This implies 1000 ETH0 requires 1111 USDC → protocol reverts due to insufficient funds.

### Impact

User redemptions can fail unexpectedly if the transaction is mined at a different price point than intended, leading to wasted gas and poor UX.
Redemptions may revert if the required collateral exceeds the treasury’s balance after a price drop.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a deadline parameter to the redeem function to ensure that redemptions are only executed within a user-defined time window:

```solidity
function redeem(
    address collateralToken,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    uint256 deadline // NEW
) external {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "ETH0: expired redemption");
    ...
}
```
This protects users from executing stale transactions and provides clearer guarantees about redemption behavior under price volatility.
