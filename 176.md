# Incorrect Rounding in `stETH` Price Calculation May Break Treasury Invariant

### Summary

The protocol relies on an invariant that the total supply of `ETH0` must always be fully backed by an equal or greater ETH-equivalent value of collateral held in the treasury. However, rounding behavior in the `stEthPerToken` function used for pricing `wstETH` rounds down by design. This rounding is not compensated for in the `Usual` contractâ€™s redemption logic, potentially allowing redemptions that break the protocol's core invariant.


### Root Cause

The `wstETH` token uses `stEthPerToken()` to determine the ETH-equivalent price of `wstETH`. This function will call `getPooledEthByShares` function in `stETH` and always rounds *down*, which means the returned price may be slightly less than the true market value:

```solidity
    function getPooledEthByShares(uint256 _sharesAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
        return _sharesAmount
            .mul(_getTotalPooledEther())
            .div(_getTotalShares());
    }
```

In [`Usual`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/utils/normalize.sol#L83) , this rounded-down price is used during redemptions in the denominator of the collateral amount calculation:

```solidity
function wadTokenAmountForPrice(uint256 wadStableAmount, uint256 wadPrice, uint8 tokenDecimals)
    internal
    pure
    returns (uint256)
{
    return Math.mulDiv(wadStableAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals, wadPrice, Math.Rounding.Floor);
}
```

This leads to a slightly larger `wstETH` amount being withdrawn than what is truly equivalent in ETH value. Over time, these rounding losses can accumulate and breach the following invariant:


> ETH0 total supply must be less than or equal to the ETH-equivalent value of collateral held.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Round down should happen

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

* Assume:

  * `stEthPerToken()` = 1.199999 ETH (rounded down in stETH side)
  * Actual fair price = 1.200000 ETH
* Redemption of 1 `ETH0`:

  * `wadTokenAmountForPrice(1e18, 1.199999e18)` returns slightly more than it would if 1.200000 were used.
  * User receives slightly more `wstETH` than fair ETH value.

Even if each instance of rounding is minor, these errors may accumulate over time, allowing users to redeem more than the true backing.

### Impact

* **Invariant Violation**: Treasury can end up holding less ETH-equivalent value than the outstanding `ETH0` supply.

This rounding gap must be explicitly accounted for in redemption logic to maintain invariant safety guarantees. This situation is also causing insolvency due to breaking 1:1 ratio.


### Mitigation

Add +1 in redemption:

```diff
    function wadTokenAmountForPrice(uint256 wadStableAmount, uint256 wadPrice, uint8 tokenDecimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
+        return Math.mulDiv(wadStableAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals, wadPrice + 1, Math.Rounding.Floor);
-        return Math.mulDiv(wadStableAmount, 10 ** tokenDecimals, wadPrice, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }
```
