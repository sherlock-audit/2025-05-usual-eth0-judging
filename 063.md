# Critical Pause Protection Missing Throughout ETH0 Contract

## Description 
The `Eth0` contract fails to implement pause protection in all critical functions without preserving pause functionality. This renders the pause mechanism completely ineffective, allowing all privileged operations and token transfers to continue uninterrupted during emergency pause states. The root cause is Missing whenNotPaused modifiers on privileged functions.

##Impact
Admins cannot stop ongoing attacks or exploits through pausing

##Proof of Concept
This overlook can be exploited if any of the address allowed with access is compromised by an attacker. The attacker can keep exploiting the role which they have even when the over all system is paused because there is no check in callable function before hand. While other contract might not be able to interact with the function because of the pause system check wallet compromise should be considered also and the pause modifier should be required 

## Recommended Mitigation
Create a whenNotPaused modifer which should be checked before any critical function is executed 

```solidity
// 1. Add whenNotPaused modifier to all privileged functions
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused { ... }
function burn(uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused { ... }
function burnFrom(...) public whenNotPaused { ... }
function setMintCap(...) external whenNotPaused { ... }
function blacklist(...) external whenNotPaused { ... }
function unBlacklist(...) external whenNotPaused { ... }
```
