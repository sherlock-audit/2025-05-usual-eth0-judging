# LidoWstEthOracle returns wstETH/stETH price, instead of wstETH/ETH

### Summary

LidoWstEthOracle#latestRoundData(), which is supposed to return the price of wstETH in ETH terms, actually returns wstETH/stETH price. This will lead to minting/redeeming of ETH0 at incorrect price, that can deviate significantly from the actual wstETH/ETH price.

stETH has depegged multiple times over its lifetime, sometimes for >5%. Whenever stETH depegs (even slightly, e.g. by 0.5%):

1. Too much ETH0 will be minted for wstETH (via `swap`)
2. Too little wstETH will be received from redemptions
3. Backing check in `mint` will be incorrect (it will overestimate the value of wstETH collateral and could allow minting when ETH0 is not actually 1:1 backed)

If stETH depegs up (stETH/ETH > 1), the effect will be the opposite.


### Root Cause

Wrong implementation of LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed#latestRoundData()

### External Pre-conditions

stETH/ETH price depegs from 1:1

### Attack Path
Let's assume 1 wstETH = 1.1 stETH

1. stETH depegs to 0.98 ETH
2. Attacker acquires 1 wstETH for 0.98*1.1 = 1.078 ETH, `swaps` 1 wstETH and mints 1.1 ETH0 
3. Attacker sells 1.1 ETH0 for 1.1 ETH on a secondary market, making 1.1 - 1.078 = 0.022 ETH of profit (minus fees if any)
4. Attacker repeats the attack in a loop until there's no profitable ETH0 pairs

### Impact

1. Too much ETH0 will be minted for wstETH (via `swap`)
2. Too little wstETH will be received from redemptions
3. Backing check in `mint` will be incorrect (it will overestimate the value of wstETH collateral and could allow minting when ETH0 is not actually 1:1 backed)

### Mitigation

Multiply the value returned from stEthPerToken by stETH/ETH CL price. `startedAt` and `updatedAt` should be retrieved from CL as well.
