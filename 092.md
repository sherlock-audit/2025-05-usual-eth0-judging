# Deflationary or Fee-on-Transfer Tokens in swap() Can Lead to Protocol Undercollateralization

### Summary

The swap function accepts arbitrary collateral tokens for minting ETH0 tokens, assuming the full amount transferred by the user is received by the treasury. However, the contract does not account for tokens that impose transfer fees or have deflationary mechanics, which reduce the amount of tokens actually received by the treasury. This results in the treasury receiving less collateral than expected, while the user receives ETH0 tokens minted against the full nominal input amount. This discrepancy can cause economic loss to the protocol treasury and threaten the system’s collateralization integrity.



### Root Cause

In [DaoCollateral.sol:swap()](https://github.com/usual-dao/eth0-protocol/blob/main/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L51), the _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0() function is called with a user-supplied amount. This value is passed to transferFrom() without validating how much was actually received by the treasury. This design assumes all tokens behave like standard ERC20s — but fee-on-transfer or deflationary tokens silently deduct a percentage during transfers, causing the treasury to receive less than the value used to mint ETH0.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Manager registers a deflationary or fee-on-transfer token as an accepted collateralToken.

Oracle returns a non-zero ETH-denominated value for that token.

User is allowed to call swap() with the deflationary token and a nominal amount.

ETH0 is minted using this amount instead of the actual received amount in the treasury.

### External Pre-conditions

The collateral token used implements a burn-on-transfer, fee-on-transfer, or deflationary logic (e.g., 1% burn).

The token’s market price remains stable or is reflected normally by the oracle.

### Attack Path

Attacker holds a fee-on-transfer token (e.g., 1% burned on every transfer).

Calls swap(feeToken, 100_000, minAmountOut) — amount = 100_000.

Treasury only receives 99_000 tokens due to the 1% fee.

ETH0 minted is calculated using full 100_000 amount via _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote().

Attacker gains more ETH0 than the protocol received in actual collateral.

Repeats this process, gradually creating a mismatch between circulating ETH0 and backing collateral.



### Impact

The protocol becomes undercollateralized by the fee percentage (e.g., 1%) for every swap using such tokens.

Over time, this can lead to a significant depeg risk and affect all ETH0 holders if trust in collateralization breaks.

The attacker gains free ETH0 tokens — potentially redeemable against honest user-supplied collateral, draining the treasury.

### PoC

Will provided coded POC on request

### Mitigation

Always measure the actual received collateral, not the user-supplied amount.

Use:

uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(treasury);
token.transferFrom(...);
uint256 received = IERC20(token).balanceOf(treasury) - balanceBefore;
