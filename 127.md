# Soft-removing a token collateral can DOS the swap function

### Summary

If the protocol remove a collateral as described in the README it could DOSed the swap function.

### Root Cause

According to the README : 
`CollateralTokens are not removable by design, they can however be soft-removed by changing their pricefeed / upgrade.`

The problem is that if the protocol try to soft-remove a collateral token this token is still used in the mint function of ETH0 as we can see here : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L146-L150 

For instance if the protocol do an upgrade in the classical oracle to revert if the collateral token is used revert then the swap function is DOSed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol team has to remove a collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Protocol team want to remove a collateral. 
2. Do an upgrade to the oracle to revert everytime the price of the collateral blacklisted is fetched. 
3. The collateral token is still in the TokenMapping contract.
4. The mint function is therefore DOSed.

### Impact

The swap function will be unusable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should implement a function to remove a collateral from the TokenMapping.
