# Small deposits would escape stable fee when redeeming

## Summary
When redeeming of tokens `_calculateFee` is called will calculate the ETH0 redeem fee that transfer the fee to the treasury. The fee is calculated as a percentage of the amount of ETH0 to redeem.

However when calculating fee it rounds than fee allowing small deposits to be rounded to 0 , this fee is used to maintain 1: 1 price of assets and Eth0 , but it can be bypassed by users who deposit small tokens.
## Description
```solidity
    function _calculateFee(uint256 eth0Amount, address collateralToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 stableFee)
    {
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        stableFee = Math.mulDiv(eth0Amount, $.redeemFee, BASIS_POINT_BASE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        uint8 tokenDecimals = IERC20Metadata(collateralToken).decimals();
        // if the token has less decimals than ETH0 we need to normalize the fee
        if (tokenDecimals < 18) {
            // we scale down the fee to the token decimals
            // and we scale it up to 18 decimals
            stableFee = Normalize.tokenAmountToWad(
                Normalize.wadAmountToDecimals(stableFee, tokenDecimals), tokenDecimals
            );
        }
    }
```
As we can see the fee is rounded down for tokens so user can avoid
## Example 
- Redeem 1 ETH0 
- Fee: 0.2% 
- That rounds to 0 in token units â†’ becomes 0 WAD again
- No fee taken
## Impact
- Loss of stable fee for protocol
## Recommended Mitigation
Round up fee
