# `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.latestRoundData()` always assumes stETH:ETH is 1:1 (pegged to ETH)

### Summary

`LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.latestRoundData()` will use the wstETH/stETH exchange rate for pricing wstETH/ETH, meaning it assumes a 1:1 ratio for stETH/ETH, which is not true most of the time.



### Root Cause

[`LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.latestRoundData()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L86-L87) function returns the price of wstETH in terms of ETH via `IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken()`.
```solidity
    function latestRoundData()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        )
    {
        // Return mock data for all fields except answer
        roundId = 1;
        answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
        startedAt = block.timestamp;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        answeredInRound = 1;
    }
```
[IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken()](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0#readContract) will return the amount of stETH for one wstETH.

The assumption made is that the stETH price is pegged to the ETH price therefore the wstETH:stETH price is used as wstETH:ETH price, but this assumption is incorrect as stETH price has multiple incidents of depegging with the ETH price (the most famous one is the one where stETH:ETH price hits 0.9394 on 20th of June 2022).

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Since the price of stETH is lower than ETH, when users deposit wstETH, more ETH0 will be minted for users.

### Impact

Since the price of stETH is lower than ETH, when users deposit wstETH, more ETH0 will be minted for users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to consider the price of stETH/ETH in `LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.latestRoundData()`.
