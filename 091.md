# Stale price in LidoWstEthOracle.getRoundData


### Summary

The **incorrect use of live data in `getRoundData()`** will cause a **false time-series price history** for **any protocol that queries past rounds**, as an **attacker will request arbitrary `roundId`s that all return the fresh spot price, inflating TWAP / stale-price guards and enabling under-collateralised borrowing or blocked liquidations**.

### Root Cause

* In [`LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.sol` the function `getRoundData(uint80)` **always returns the current value of `stEthPerToken()` and `block.timestamp`, regardless of the `roundId_` supplied**, instead of the data actually recorded for that round.

### Internal Pre-conditions
N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker deposits wstETH** as collateral in the target protocol.
2. Price **drops** on external markets, but not yet reflected in `stEthPerToken()` (slow-moving) - or the attacker simply acts before the protocol’s risk checks run.
3. **Attacker calls the protocol’s borrow function**, which internally:

   1. Queries **`getRoundData()` for several past `roundId`s** (e.g., last n = 24).
   2. Receives **identical “current” price & timestamps** for every round.
   3. Computes an **inflated TWAP / freshness check that passes**.
4. Protocol **lets the attacker borrow more ETH/stablecoins** than their real collateral value supports.
5. **Price finally updates** or separate liquidation logic notices the drop; collateral is insufficient, leaving the protocol with bad debt.


### Impact

The **protocol’s liquidity pool (and ultimately its other users or insurance fund)** suffers a **potential 100 % loss of the value over-borrowed**. The attacker walks away with the borrowed assets, minus any liquidation penalties they may incur later.

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation

* **Stateful round tracking** – persist `answer`, `startedAt`, `updatedAt`, and incrementing `roundId` on each update.
* **Revert** in `getRoundData()` when `roundId_ != latestRoundId`.
* **Document** that the contract is *“latest-only”* if historical rounds will not be supported.
