# funds will be stolen bacause of unreliable Oracle Pricing

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L129-L166

Function Affected: `mint()`

This function is designed to mint new ETH0 tokens only when they are fully backed by collateral held in the treasury.

However, the check that prevents over-minting is flawed, allowing an attacker or user to mint more tokens than what is actually backed, leading to system insolvency and loss of peg.

### Root Cause

The system blindly trusts the calculated backing value (wadCollateralBackingInETH) without verifying whether that value is accurate, up-to-date, and immune to manipulation.



### Internal Pre-conditions

no need

### External Pre-conditions

no need

### Attack Path

1. Malicious token added to collateralTokens
2. Attacker pumps its price on DEX (e.g., trades 0.1 ETH for 1 token, creating an artificial spot price of 10 ETH)
3. Oracle picks up price = 10 ETH
4. Treasury holds 1 million of that token
5. wadCollateralBackingInETH = 10,000,000 ETH
6. Attacker mints millions of ETH0 (which are assumed to be pegged to real ETH)
6. Swaps minted ETH0 on DEX for real ETH or stablecoins
6. Oracle price corrects → wadCollateralBackingInETH drops → system is now insolvent

### Impact

- ETH0 becomes undercollateralized or completely unbacked
- Price collapses or depegs
- Honest users suffer financial loss
- Protocol reputation is ruined
- Attackers profit from arbitrage

### PoC

no need

### Mitigation

1. Add Oracle Data Freshness Validation
```solidity
(uint256 price, uint256 updatedAt) = oracle.getPriceWithTimestamp(token);
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < 1800, "Stale oracle data");
```
2. Add Minimum Collateralization Ratio
```solidity
require(totalSupply() + amount <= wadCollateralBackingInETH * 100 / 120, "Insufficient collateral backing");

```
