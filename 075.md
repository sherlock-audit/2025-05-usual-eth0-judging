# Lack of nonce would allow replay in `swapPermit`

## Summary
The `swapPermit`  is sswap method with permit function that enable you to swap your collateralToken for stablecoin with permit will exchange LST (collateralToken) for ETH0 (stableToken). However it fails to add nonce to prevent delayed swap requests from being replayed.
## Description
```solidity
    function swapWithPermit(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
        try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
            msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
        ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    }
```
Various parameters are are passed including ones to prevent slippage , However it involves signature without incuding nonce allowing valid signatures to be replayed by an attacker
## Impact
Replay of quote swaps

## Recommended Mitigation
Add nonce to the parameter
