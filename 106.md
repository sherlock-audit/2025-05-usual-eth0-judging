# `swapWithPermit` allows invalid signatures to bypass `permit` checks and trigger forced swaps

### Summary

The `swapWithPermit` function wraps the `permit` call in a `try-catch`, but the catch block is completely empty. As a result, even if the permit call reverts due to an invalid signature, it gets silently ignored, and the function continues to execute `swap`.
This allows anyone to trigger a `swap` using a fake signature, as long as the victim has previously approved the collateral token (often with a maximum allowance).

### Root Cause

In [DaoCollateral.sol#L531-L533](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L531-L533) within the `swapWithPermit` function, the `permit` call is wrapped inside a `try-catch` block:

```solidity
    function swapWithPermit(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
@>      try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
@>          msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
@>      ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    }
```

However, no error handling is implemented in the `catch` block. As a result, if the `permit` call fails due to an invalid signature, the error is silently ignored and the `swap` function proceeds as usual. This effectively bypasses the `permit` check for any input.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The user has previously approved the collateral token.

### Attack Path

Let’s consider the following scenario:
1. Alice holds `1000` RWA tokens and has already approved the protocol to spend them (usually with a max allowance).
2. Bob creates an invalid signature, possibly one he signed himself, and uses it to call `swapWithPermit` on behalf of Alice, swapping all of her RWA tokens.
3. The `permit` call fails due to the invalid signature, but the empty catch block silently swallows the error. The `swap` then executes successfully.
4. Alice’s RWA tokens are forcibly converted into ETH0. She ends up with `0` RWA tokens and `1000` ETH0 tokens, without her knowledge or consent.

### Impact

Any attacker can force users to perform swaps they never intended, using their pre-approved tokens. Even if the protocol enforces a 1:1 peg, forcibly converting RWA into ETH0 still violates user expectations and autonomy.

### PoC

Add the following test case to `test/DaoCollateral.t.sol`:

```solidity
    function testSwapWithPermitInvalidSignature() public {
        uint256 amount = 1000e6;
        uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 1 days;
        // 1. Create tokens and assign 1000 RWA tokens to Alice.
        (RwaMock token, Eth0 stbc) = setupCreationRwa1_withMint(6, amount);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(alice), amount);
        // 2. Bob creates a signature by signing it himself (not from Alice)
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) =
            _getSelfPermitData(address(token), alice, bobPrivKey, bob, amount, deadline);
        // 3. swapWithPermit executes successfully.
        vm.prank(alice);
        daoCollateral.swapWithPermit(address(token), amount, amount, deadline, v, r, s);
        // 4. Alice ends up with 0 RWA tokens and 1000 ETH0 tokens.
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(alice), 0);
        assertEq(stbc.balanceOf(alice), amount * 1e12);
    }
```

Run the test with:

```shell
forge test --mt testSwapWithPermitInvalidSignature  -vv
```

Output:

### Mitigation

Consider removing the `try-catch` block entirely. Make sure the `permit` call either succeeds or the transaction reverts with a clear error.
