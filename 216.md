# Ineffective Use of Permit in `DaoCollateral::swapWithPermit` Due to Empty Catch Block and msg.sender Restriction

### Summary

In  the `DaoCollateral::swapWithPermit`, the implementation defeats the core purpose of ERC-2612 permit functionality by enforcing `msg.sender` validation, while silently ignoring permit failures through an empty catch block.

### Root Cause

In `DaoCollateral.sol::L531`  there is a flawed permit implementation:
```solidity
try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
    msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
) {} catch {} // Empty catch block ignores all errors
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/995d35f32c762aec7f678292b8702bc71aec1247/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L531

The permit function signature is:
```solidity
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint value, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.User signs a valid permit offline for gasless transaction
2. Relayer submits transaction with valid signature
3. Permit fails because `msg.sender (relayer) â‰  owner (user)`
4. Error is silently ignored due to empty catch block
5. `safeTransferFrom` fails, transaction reverts
6. User pays gas fees despite having valid permit

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path


Alice wants to sign the transaction, and usually it's passed to a relayer that will actually use it, and this could be offline in cases where Alice does not have gas, it's a primary goal ERC 2612-Permit solves
but the current implementation does not allow that, Alice has to sign a permit and still run the transaction. She might as well just approve the transaction and still run it herself. Two transactions.

### Impact

Defeats the Purpose of Permit solving gas issues for users

### Mitigation

```diff
     function swapWithPermit(
+      address owner,
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
        try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
  -       msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, 
  +       owner, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
        ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    } 
```
