# Missing Check for Zero Price in Collateral Valuation During Mint

## Finding description and impact

In the `mint` function, the contract calculates total collateral value backing the ETH0 token using oracle prices for each accepted collateral token.

It loops over all collateral tokens and fetches their price from the oracle:

```solidity
uint256 collateralTokenPriceInETH = uint256(oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
```

But there is no check to ensure that `collateralTokenPriceInETH` is not zero.

If a token’s price is returned as zero, its balance is skipped from the backing value calculation. This can lead to an **incorrectly low** total collateral estimate.

## code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L149

**Impact:**

* The function may allow minting even when backing is insufficient.
* A faulty oracle returning zero can reduce the system’s collateral visibility.
* If a malicious token price is set to zero, it allows undercollateralized minting.

## Mitigation

Before using the token price in calculations, ensure it is greater than zero:

```solidity
if (collateralTokenPriceInETH == 0) {
    revert InvalidPrice();
}
```

This makes sure all collateral tokens used for backing have valid oracle prices. It avoids silent failures and enforces data quality for minting decisions.
