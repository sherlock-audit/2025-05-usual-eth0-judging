# Rounding in _getQuoteInETH Favors Protocol During ETH0 Minting, Potentially Contradicting Stated Design Principle for User-Favorable Rounding in Fee Calculations

### Summary

The `_getQuoteInETH` function in `DaoCollateral.sol`, which calculates the amount of ETH0 to be minted for a given amount of collateral, {root cause: uses `Math.Rounding.Floor` (rounding down) via `Math.mulDiv` when determining the ETH0 equivalent of the provided collateral}. This will cause {impact: users to receive slightly less ETH0 than an exact mathematical conversion (or rounding to nearest/up) would yield if there's a fractional part that is truncated} for {affected party: users performing a `swap` (mint ETH0) operation}. This rounding behavior favors the protocol by effectively requiring slightly more collateral per unit of ETH0 minted (or minting slightly less ETH0 for the same collateral value). This specific behavior {vulnerability path: occurs during every `swap` operation where the precise ETH0 equivalent of the collateral has a fractional component. The function's rounding down} potentially contradicts the spirit of the Q&A statement "Fee calculation rounding favors users over the protocol," if that principle was intended to imply a broader user-favorable rounding philosophy across all user-facing value calculations, not strictly limited to explicit fee computations.


### Root Cause

- In `DaoCollateral.sol`, within the `_getQuoteInETH` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L405
```solidity
  function _getQuoteInETH(uint256 tokenAmount, address collateralToken)
      internal
      view
      returns (uint256 wadAmountInETH)
  {
      (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals) = _getPriceAndDecimals(collateralToken);
      uint256 wadAmount = tokenAmount.tokenAmountToWad(decimals); // Normalizes collateral amount to 18 decimals
      // Calculates the ETH equivalent (which becomes ETH0 amount) for the collateral
      wadAmountInETH = Math.mulDiv(wadAmount, wadPriceInETH, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor); // Rounding down occurs here
  }
```
The function calculates wadAmountInETH = (wadAmount * wadPriceInETH) / SCALAR_ONE and explicitly uses Math.Rounding.Floor. When a user provides collateralToken to mint ETH0 (via the swap function, which calls this helper), the amount of ETH0 they receive (wadAmountInETH) is rounded down if the precise mathematical result contains a fractional part. This means the user receives marginally less ETH0 than they would if, for example, rounding to the nearest unit or rounding up were applied. The protocol benefits by retaining the value of the rounded-down fraction against the provided collateral, effectively making the minted ETH0 slightly more over-collateralized.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A user calls the `swap(address collateralToken, uint256 amount, uint256 minAmountOut)` function to mint ETH0 by providing `amount` of `collateralToken`.
2.  The internal calculation `(wadAmount * wadPriceInETH)` (where `wadAmount` is the 18-decimal representation of the input `amount` of `collateralToken`, and `wadPriceInETH` is its price in ETH also at 18 decimals) is not perfectly divisible by `SCALAR_ONE` (typically `1e18`), resulting in a non-zero remainder if precise division were performed.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  None specific, other than a user interacting with the `swap` function to mint ETH0.


### Attack Path

*(This describes an illustrative behavior path, not an attack in the traditional sense, but a consistent outcome of the rounding logic)*
1.  A user intends to mint ETH0 by supplying an `amount` of `collateralToken`.
2.  The user calls `DaoCollateral.swap(collateralToken, userCollateralAmount, minAmountOutETH0)`.
3.  Internally, `_swapCheckAndGetETHQuote` calls `_getQuoteInETH(userCollateralAmount, collateralToken)`.
4.  Inside `_getQuoteInETH`:
    a.  `wadAmount` (user's `userCollateralAmount` normalized to 18 decimals) and `wadPriceInETH` (price of `collateralToken` in ETH, 18 decimals) are determined.
    b.  `wadAmountInETH` is calculated as `Math.mulDiv(wadAmount, wadPriceInETH, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor)`.
    c.  Suppose the precise mathematical result of `(wadAmount * wadPriceInETH) / SCALAR_ONE` is `X.Y` ETH0 (e.g., `100.000000000000000005 * 1e18` ETH0, where `0.Y` represents the fractional part `5 wei`).
    d.  Due to `Math.Rounding.Floor`, the `wadAmountInETH` actually returned and used for minting becomes `X` (e.g., `100.000000000000000000 * 1e18` ETH0).
5.  The user receives `X` amount of ETH0. The value corresponding to the `0.Y` fractional part of ETH0 (in this example, `5 wei` worth of ETH0), which was backed by their provided collateral, effectively accrues to the protocol because the collateral for it was taken, but the ETH0 for this fraction was not minted to the user.


### Impact

* Users consistently receive a minutely smaller amount of ETH0 during `swap` (minting) operations than a precise mathematical conversion (or rounding-to-nearest/up) would yield, whenever the calculation results in a fractional part that is subsequently rounded down.
* While the value "lost" by the user (or "gained" by the protocol in terms of slightly better collateralization per ETH0 minted) per individual transaction is likely to be very small (dust-level), this systematically favors the protocol over the user in the ETH0 minting process. Over a large volume of `swap` transactions or a long period, the accumulated value could become non-negligible for the protocol.
* This behavior **directly contradicts the Q&A statement**: "Fee calculation rounding favors users over the protocol, e.g. In the _calculateFee() function of the DaoCollateral contract we are rounding down." if this principle is interpreted as a general design philosophy for user-facing value calculations. In `_calculateFee`, rounding down *reduces* the fee paid by the user (user-favorable). In `_getQuoteInETH`, rounding down *reduces* the ETH0 received by the user (protocol-favorable).
* Affected Party: Users who mint ETH0 via the `swap` function (they receive slightly less ETH0 than a different rounding method might provide). The LEND protocol (actually ETH0 protocol) benefits by a marginal increase in its effective collateralization ratio for the ETH0 minted.
