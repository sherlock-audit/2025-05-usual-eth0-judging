# The incorrect implementation of oracle timestamp validation in LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed will cause a critical fund loss vulnerability

### Summary

The incorrect implementation of oracle timestamp validation in LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed will cause a critical fund loss vulnerability for ETH0 token holders and liquidity providers as any external user with sufficient capital to acquire wstETH (through spot markets, flash loans, or existing holdings) will exploit the always-current timestamp during stETH depegging events to mint ETH0 tokens at inflated collateral valuations, bypassing the protocol's oracle timeout safety mechanism without requiring any special permissions or privileged roles."

**Root cause**: The incorrect implementation of oracle timestamp validation in LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed
**Impact**: critical fund loss vulnerability
**Affected party**: ETH0 token holders and liquidity providers (who would suffer from dilution and undercollateralization)
**Actor**: any external user with sufficient capital to acquire wstETH
No special permissions needed
No privileged roles required
Only needs access to wstETH (which can be obtained through multiple means)
**Attack path**: exploit the always-current timestamp during stETH depegging events to mint ETH0 tokens at inflated collateral valuations, bypassing the protocol's oracle timeout safety mechanism
Additional actor details:
No whitelist requirements
No governance participation needed
No protocol roles required
Only needs:
Enough capital to acquire wstETH
Ability to interact with the protocol's public functions
Understanding of the timing during stETH depegging events


### Root Cause

[In eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol:71-92](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/oracles/LidoWstEthOracle.sol#L72-L91) the oracle implementation always returns block.timestamp for both startedAt and updatedAt in latestRoundData():

![Image](https://sherlock-files.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gh-images/160a74d5-0526-48c4-90c8-8b3e5145c4cc)

This causes the timeout check in eth0-protocol/src/oracles/ClassicalOracle.sol:71-92 to always pass:

![Image](https://sherlock-files.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gh-images/14d88b7d-e506-43a3-b99e-daad827f826c)

As updatedAt is always equal to block.timestamp, the condition block.timestamp > timeout + block.timestamp can never be true, effectively nullifying the stale price protection mechanism.
This is a clear code-level implementation mistake where the oracle wrapper fails to maintain proper timestamp accounting, breaking a critical security assumption of the price validation system.



### Internal Pre-conditions

Here are the internal pre-conditions for the vulnerability:

1. Admin needs to call initializeTokenOracle() to set wstETH as a collateral token in TokenMapping.sol with the LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed as its oracle source.
2. Admin needs to set the oracle timeout in ClassicalOracle.sol to be greater than 0 (any non-zero value will work due to the vulnerability)
3. The total value of wstETH in the treasury needs to be greater than 0 to allow for minting operations
4. The ETH0 mint cap needs to be set to a value greater than 0 to allow minting operations
5. The stETH/ETH price needs to deviate from 1:1 by an amount that makes the attack profitable (considering gas costs and slippage)
6. The protocol's swap() function in DaoCollateral.sol must not be paused (default state)
7. The protocol's global pause in DaoCollateral.sol must not be active (default state)
8. The CBR (Counter Bank Run) mode in DaoCollateral.sol must not be active (default state is false)


### External Pre-conditions

Required Condition (Must be met):
1. stETH/ETH price needs to deviate from 1:1 (a depeg event) within the Lido protocol
   - This is the core requirement that makes the attack possible
   - Even a small deviation (e.g., 2-3%) could be profitable at scale

AND any ONE of these liquidity conditions (Only one needed):
2. At least one of these must be true for acquiring wstETH:
   - Aave wstETH liquidity pool has > 100 wstETH available for flash loans
   - OR Balancer/Curve pools have sufficient wstETH/ETH liquidity
   - OR CEX order books have sufficient wstETH/ETH liquidity

The following conditions are automatically true during a depeg, so they're not separate requirements:
- The Chainlink stETH/ETH price feed will report the depegged price (this follows from condition 1)
- The Lido protocol's stEthPerToken() function continues operating normally (this is by design)
- The ETH0 protocol's Monitoring Bot not triggering is implied by the attack working

So to simplify:
1. MUST HAVE: stETH/ETH depeg event (any significant deviation)
2. MUST HAVE: Access to wstETH through ANY ONE liquidity source



### Attack Path


1. Attacker monitors stETH/ETH price for a depeg event using on-chain or off-chain monitoring

2. When depeg occurs, attacker executes the following in a single transaction:
   - Attacker calls flashLoan() on Aave to borrow a large amount of wstETH
   - OR swaps ETH for wstETH on Curve/Balancer
   - OR acquires wstETH through any available market

3. Attacker calls approve() on the wstETH token contract to allow DaoCollateral to spend their wstETH

4. Attacker calls DaoCollateral.swap(wstETH_ADDRESS, amount, minAmountOut):
   - The function calls _swapCheckAndGetETHQuote() which:
     - Fetches price from LidoProxyWstETHPriceFeed.latestRoundData()
     - Gets block.timestamp as updatedAt
     - Passes oracle timeout check due to block.timestamp always being current
     - Calculates ETH0 to mint based on pre-depeg valuation

5. Protocol mints ETH0 tokens to attacker based on the inflated wstETH valuation:
   - _transferCollateralTokenAndMintEth0() transfers wstETH to treasury
   - Mints ETH0 at 1:1 ratio based on the reported ETH value

6. Attacker immediately:
   - Sells ETH0 for ETH through available liquidity pools
   - OR uses ETH0 as collateral in lending protocols
   - OR holds ETH0 to redeem later when stETH repeg occurs

7. If flash loan was used:
   - Repays flash loan with profits from the inflated ETH0 minting
   - Keeps the difference as profit

8. Optional: Attacker can repeat steps 2-7 multiple times as long as:
   - The depeg condition persists
   - There is sufficient liquidity
   - The protocol's monitoring bot hasn't triggered a pause

Each iteration of this attack:
- Further dilutes existing ETH0 holders
- Increases protocol undercollateralization
- Generates more profit for the attacker
- Makes the eventual impact of the depeg more severe

The attack requires no special permissions, can be executed atomically in a single transaction, and becomes more profitable with larger amounts of capital deployed.


### Impact

The ETH0 protocol and its token holders suffer a loss proportional to the stETH depeg percentage (historically up to 7%) multiplied by the amount of wstETH used in the attack. The attacker gains the difference between the inflated ETH0 minting value and the true market value of the wstETH.

**Specific numerical example:**
If stETH depegs to 0.93 ETH (7% drop, based on June 2022 events)
Attacker flash loans 1000 wstETH (worth ~1000 ETH pre-depeg)
Protocol mints 1000 ETH0 (based on oracle's inflated valuation)
True value of collateral is 930 ETH (post-depeg)
Protocol suffers 70 ETH worth of undercollateralization
Attacker gains 70 ETH minus flash loan fees and gas costs per attack iteration

The impact scales linearly with the amount of wstETH used in the attack and can be repeated multiple times as long as:
The depeg condition persists
Liquidity is available
Protocol's monitoring bot hasn't triggered a pause
This represents a direct profit for the attacker and an equivalent loss for the protocol and its users, potentially leading to systemic undercollateralization of the ETH0 token.

To test: 

1) Deploy the exploit contract code is pasted below:

```javascript
// Deploy script
async function main() {
    const AAVE_ADDRESS_PROVIDER = "0x2f39d218133AFaB8F2B819B1066c7E434Ad94E9e"; // Mainnet
    
    const ExploitFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("ETH0OracleExploit");
    const exploit = await ExploitFactory.deploy(AAVE_ADDRESS_PROVIDER);
    await exploit.deployed();
    
    console.log("Exploit deployed to:", exploit.address);
}
```

2) Test the Oracle Manipulation:


```javascript
// Test script
async function testExploit() {
    const exploit = await ethers.getContractAt("ETH0OracleExploit", EXPLOIT_ADDRESS);
    


    // Verify oracle timestamp manipulation
    const timestamp = await exploit.testOracleTimestamp();
    console.log("Oracle timestamp:", timestamp.toString());
    console.log("Block timestamp:", (await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest")).timestamp);
   

    // Execute attack with 1000 wstETH
    const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther("1000");
    await exploit.executeAttack(amount);
}
```

```javascript
// Verification script
async function verifyImpact() {
    const daoCollateral = await ethers.getContractAt("IDaoCollateral", DAO_COLLATERAL_ADDRESS);
    const eth0 = await ethers.getContractAt("IERC20", ETH0_ADDRESS);
    
    // Check ETH0 balance of attacker
    const balance = await eth0.balanceOf(EXPLOIT_ADDRESS);
    console.log("ETH0 minted:", ethers.utils.formatEther(balance));
    
    // Check protocol's collateralization
    const treasury = await daoCollateral.treasury();
    const wstETH = await ethers.getContractAt("IERC20", WSTETH_ADDRESS);
    const collateral = await wstETH.balanceOf(treasury);
    console.log("wstETH in treasury:", ethers.utils.formatEther(collateral));
}
```

            revert StalePrice();

        return (
            1, // roundId

            revert ExcessivePriceDeviation();

And update the DaoCollateral to use additional safety checks: // In DaoCollateral.sol

```solidity
function _getQuoteInETH(uint256 tokenAmount, address collateralToken)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 wadAmountInETH)
{
    (uint256 wadPriceInETH, uint8 decimals) = _getPriceAndDecimals(collateralToken);
    
    // Add additional validation for wstETH specifically
    if (collateralToken == WSTETH) {
        // Check Chainlink stETH/ETH price feed as secondary source
        uint256 chainlinkPrice = getChainlinkStEthPrice();
        uint256 deviation = calculateDeviation(wadPriceInETH, chainlinkPrice);
        
        if (deviation > MAX_ALLOWED_DEVIATION) {
            revert PriceDeviation();
        }
    }
    
    uint256 wadAmount = tokenAmount.tokenAmountToWad(decimals);
    wadAmountInETH = Math.mulDiv(wadAmount, wadPriceInETH, SCALAR_ONE, Math.Rounding.Floor);
}
```
Key Mitigation Points:
1) Proper Timestamp Tracking:
-Maintains lastUpdateTimestamp separately from block.timestamp
-Enforces maximum price delay through MAX_PRICE_DELAY

2) Price Update Mechanism:
-Requires explicit price updates through updatePrice()
-Stores last valid price in state
-Validates price is positive

3) Price Deviation Checks:
-Implements maximum deviation between updates
-Prevents sudden large price movements
-Multiple Oracle Sources:
-Adds Chainlink price feed as secondary source
-Compares prices from different sources
-Reverts on significant deviations

4) Clear Error Handling:
-Custom errors for different failure cases
-Better error reporting and debugging
