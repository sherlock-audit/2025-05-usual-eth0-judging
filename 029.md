# Discrepancy in the pausing mechanism between `activateCBR` and `deactivateCBR`

### Summary

Discrepancy in the pausing mechanism between `activateCBR` and `deactivateCBR` leads to halting swap operations unnecessarily.

### Root Cause

In [`DaoCollateral.sol::activateCBR()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L257) swaps are paused (line 257).

In [`DaoCollateral.sol::deactivateCBR()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L264-L270) however, swaps are not unpaused.

This will unnecessarily halt swap operations and disrupt user experience.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Not an attack, but the issue can happen as follows: 
- Admin calls `activateCBR()`, swaps are automatically paused.
- After some time, the admin deactivate CBR, but swaps will still be paused indefinitely.

### Impact

Halts protocol operations unnecessarily. As users trying to swap after CBR has been deactivated will fail.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
    function deactivateCBR() external {
        _requireOnlyAdmin();
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        if ($.isCBROn == false) revert SameValue();
        $.isCBROn = false;
        $._swapPaused = false;
        emit CBRDeactivated();
        emit SwapUnPaused();
    }
```
