# Missing Verification for Zero Price in Collateral Valuation During Mint



## Finding description and impact

Within the `mint` function, the contract derives the total collateral backing the ETH0 token by querying oracle prices for each eligible collateral asset.

The code iterates through every collateral token and retrieves its price via the oracle:

```solidity
uint256 collateralTokenPriceInETH = uint256(oracle.getPrice(collateralToken));
```

However, there is no safeguard to confirm that `collateralTokenPriceInETH` is nonzero.

If an oracle returns a price of zero for any token, that token’s balance is effectively omitted from the total collateral calculation. This omission can result in a **significantly understated** collateral value.

**Code snippet:**

### Impact

* Without verifying that a token’s price is nonzero, the contract may permit mint operations even when overall backing is inadequate.
* A malfunctioning oracle that returns zero causes that token’s collateral to be completely ignored, distorting the protocol’s true reserve status.
* An attacker could deliberately set a token’s oracle price to zero, allowing them to mint ETH0 with insufficient backing and undermine the stability of the system.

## Mitigation

Introduce a check to ensure the retrieved price is positive before proceeding with any calculations:

```solidity
if (collateralTokenPriceInETH == 0) {
    revert InvalidPrice();
}
```

By enforcing this validation, every collateral token included in the backing calculation must have a valid, nonzero oracle price. This prevents silent failures and guarantees accurate collateral assessment during minting.
