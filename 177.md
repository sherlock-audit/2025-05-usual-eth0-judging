# Potential DoS in redeem fee when admin unknowingly changes redeem fee and front runs a user's transaction

### Summary

The `redeem` function allows user's to redeem collateral tokens for `ETH0`. The parameter `minAmountOut` in the function perfectly takes away the any slippage risks. But in current implementation, the `setRedeemFee` function, which is an admin function, is callable by admin at any time without any bounds and restrictions. 
If a user estimates their `minAmountOut` based on the currently visible redeem fee and submits a transaction, and the admin updates the fee before that tx is mined, the redemption may revert due to `returnedCollateral < minAmountOut`.
The same problem lies with the `activateCBR` function. If admin activates the `CBR` mechanism, the tx will revert as the user calculated the slippage only basis of redeem fee.

Although these doesn’t result in unexpected loss of funds due to the `minAmountOut` check, but they create a denial-of-service vector.

### Root Cause

No usage of pause checks, either of the whole protocol or only for redeem function in `activateCBR` and `setRedeemFee` admin functions.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to call `setRedeemFee` or `activateCBR` when a user initiated a redeem and unknowingly frontrun him.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

1. **Denial-of-service:** Legitimate user redemptions can be reverted simply by raising the fee above what users account for.
2. **Loss of Funds:** Users can loose their funds if they don't calculate the `minAmountOut` accurately. As currently there is no external function is present for users to calculate it.
3. **Gas griefing:** Users may lose gas fees due to admin-triggered tx reverts.

### PoC

**DoS vulnerability flow in the functions:**


1. Assume the current `redeemFee` is 1%.
2. User checks redeemable amount and submits a `redeem()` tx with `minAmountOut` set accordingly.
3. Admin calls `setRedeemFee(500)` (i.e. 5%) before the user’s tx is mined.
4. User’s tx reverts with `AmountTooLow()` as the `returnedCollateral` is now less than `minAmountOut`.
5. Or user get's much lower amount if he didn't use the slippage protection parameter.


### Mitigation

Just simple use `wheRedeemPaused` modifiers in the functions to make them only callable when redeem is paused. Or call `pause` in these functions before changing the fees and activating CBR to pause the whole functionality. Then call `unpause` in the end to unpause the protocol.

Add checks like this to mitigate the issue

```solidity
function setRedeemFee(uint256 _redeemFee) external whenRedeemPaused {
if (_redeemFee > MAX_REDEEM_FEE) revert RedeemFeeTooBig();
        if (_redeemFee == 0) revert RedeemFeeCannotBeZero();
        _requireOnlyAdmin();
        DaoCollateralStorageV0 storage $ = _daoCollateralStorageV0();
        if ($.redeemFee == _redeemFee) revert SameValue();
        $.redeemFee = _redeemFee;
        emit RedeemFeeUpdated(_redeemFee);
    }
```
