# Issue: Ineffective Use of `permit` in `swapWithPermit` Function, resulting in DoS

### Summary

**Severity: Medium (Inefficient Logic ).**
**Type:  Misleading Functionality/Core Functionality Break.**

The function `swapWithPermit` allows  users to pass a signature (via v, r, s) to permit a token transfer. But in the current logic, the permit is implementend in a way that only same user will be able to call the this function who signed the data.  This pattern negates the primary benefit of `permit`, which is to allow for `gasless approval` by signing off-chain and having another party (e.g., a relayer or contract) submit the transaction.

### Root Cause

The function `swapWithPermit` allows a user to pass a signature (via v, r, s) to permit a token transfer using the ERC-2612 `permit()` standard, and then immediately proceeds with a swap:

```solidity
function swapWithPermit(
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
        try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
            msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
        ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        swap(collateralToken, amount, minAmountOut);
    }
```
In its current usage pattern — as show in the code  — the same user signs the `permit` and submits the transaction themselves. This not only negates the primary benefit of using `permit`, but also is has no practical benefit if the user is already submitting the transaction on-chain themselves. This will lead to confusion in the users and they will definitely try to use it as it should be, by providing their signatures to other users or contracts and these users and contracts who have the signatures will pay the fees for original user. These transactions will result in DoS and revert because of current logic.

The **Root Cause** for this problem is the usage of `msg.sender` in the  `swapWithPermit` function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

**1. User signs and submits**:

- The user generates a valid `permit` signature off-chain.
- They send a transaction to `swapWithPermit()` passing that signature.
- However, they still **pay gas for the transaction**, and the `permit()` call itself adds extra gas (ECDSA signature recovery, state changes), sometimes costing more than a regular `approve()` + `swap()` pair.
- Most of the times, users will give their signature to other users as it is generally done with `permit`. The other user will try to call the function `swapWithPermit` which will result in a DoS and eventually revert.

**2. Resulting in worse experience and higher gas costs:**

- The user experiences degraded performance, higher costs, and confusing approval flows.
- Integrators may unknowingly expose this inefficient path to many users at scale.
- This opens up a “griefing vector” where users are misled into using an inefficient flow by design — not due to malicious actors, but due to flawed interface expectations.

### Impact

**1.** **Inefficient use of permit** as permits are generally used because they provide the functionality of gasless transactions for signers. This implementation breaks the core logic of permits. This implementation of permit function will not allow other user's to pay for someone else.
**2.** **Invalid reverts** will occur and users will face `Denial of Service` because the current implementation doesn't supports a user to pay gas fees for someone else.

### PoC

PoC for DoS caused by a user using a signature of another user to pay the gas fee on his behalf which is the correct use of permit:-

```solidity
function test_PoCForSwapWithPermit() public {
        (address ethCollateralToken, Eth0 eth0) = setupCreationRwaLido();
        deal(ethCollateralToken, alice, 20e18); // 20 wstETH

        (uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = _getAlicePermitData(
            block.timestamp + 2 hours, ethCollateralToken, address(daoCollateral), 10e18
        );

        //bob swaps using alice's signature

        vm.prank(bob);
        vm.expectRevert();
        daoCollateral.swapWithPermit(ethCollateralToken, 10e18, 10e18, deadline, v, r, s);
    }
```

### Mitigation

The current implementation uses `msg.sender` in the function where the permit is verified. Instead of using this `msg.sender` variable, another address parameter should be provided in the function. If owner is calling the function, he will add his own address, and if someone is paying on behalf of other user, he will just use that user's address.

```solidity
function swapWithPermit(
        address signer 
        address collateralToken,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external {
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-empty-blocks
        try IERC20Permit(collateralToken).permit(
            signer, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s
        ) {} catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks
        ---rest of the logic---
    }
```
