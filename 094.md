# Lack of Emergency Token Recovery Function Tokens Sent to Contract Are Lost Forever

### Lack of Emergency Token Recovery Tokens Sent to Contract Are Lost Forever

**Description:**  
The `DaoCollateral` contract does not provide a mechanism for recovering ERC20 tokens that are accidentally sent directly to the contract address (rather than the treasury). Since the contract does not track or use tokens held at its own address, these tokens become permanently inaccessible.

LOC: `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L61`

**Impact:**  
- Any ERC20 tokens sent to the contract address by mistake are irretrievable.
- Users or integrators who make this mistake will lose their funds.
- This can result in permanent loss of user or protocol funds and a negative user experience.

**Proof of Concept:**  
1. A user mistakenly sends 100 USDC to the `DaoCollateral` contract address.
2. The contract has no function to withdraw or recover these tokens.
3. The tokens remain stuck in the contract forever, as there is no way for anyone (including the admin) to access them.

**Recommended Mitigation:**  
Implement an emergency token recovery function, restricted to the admin, that allows the recovery of any ERC20 tokens sent to the contract by mistake. For example:

```solidity
/// @notice Allows the admin to recover ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to this contract.
/// @param token The address of the ERC20 token.
/// @param to The address to send the recovered tokens to.
/// @param amount The amount of tokens to recover.
function emergencyTokenRecovery(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external {
    _requireOnlyAdmin();
    IERC20Metadata(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);
}
```
