# Missing Slippage Check in redeemDao() Enables Loss from Price Volatility

### Summary

The redeemDao() function allows the DAO to redeem ETH0 for its underlying collateral but does not include any slippage protection. While the standard redeem() function implements a minimum output check (minAmountOut) to guard against volatile or stale pricing, this safeguard is absent in the DAO-specific redemption path. As a result, the DAO may unintentionally redeem ETH0 at unfavorable rates during periods of price deviation, especially if lower-liquidity or higher-volatility LST tokens are added in the future.

### Root Cause

The redeemDao() function lacks a minAmountOut parameter or any equivalent mechanism to validate the output amount before executing the collateral transfer. This omission stands in contrast to the standard redeem() function, which includes:

```solidity

if (amountOut < minAmountOut) {
    revert AmountTooLow();
}

```
In [redeemDao()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/daoCollateral/DaoCollateral.sol#L564) collateral is transferred without checking the resulting quote against a minimum acceptable threshold, creating an opening for unprotected execution under volatile or manipulated pricing conditions.

This risk is currently limited due to the use of wstETH, which has relatively stable pricing. However, as the protocol has signaled its intent to support additional LSTs, the absence of slippage protection could expose DAO-held ETH0 to redemption at underpriced collateral rates.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No needed

### External Pre-conditions

Price volatility is needed on collateral token side

### Attack path

No needed, price volatility may happen any time in ETH0/Collateral pair. 

### Impact

DAO may redeem ETH0 at a poor rate, especially under temporary price dips or oracle delays. Therefore, it will cause loss of funds for DAO.

### Mitigation

Apply same slippage check for redeemDao function
