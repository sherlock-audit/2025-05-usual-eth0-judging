# Incorrect Price Calculation

### Summary


The core issue lies in the fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between wstETH, stETH, and ETH:


answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
This implementation incorrectly assumes that:

wstETH/stETH ratio equals wstETH/ETH price

stETH and ETH are always 1:1



The Reality of Lido's Token System

wstETH (Wrapped Staked ETH):

ERC-20 wrapper for stETH

Represents staked ETH + rewards

Conversion rate: wstETH → stETH = stEthPerToken()



stETH (Liquid Staked ETH):

Rebasing token representing staked ETH



Value fluctuates relative to ETH based on:

Staking rewards

Market demand on exchanges

Withdrawal queue status



ETH:

Base cryptocurrency

Price Relationship


The correct wstETH/ETH price is:

wstETH/ETH = (wstETH/stETH) × (stETH/ETH)

Where:

wstETH/stETH = stEthPerToken() (from wstETH contract)

stETH/ETH = Market exchange rate (from external oracle)



Scenario |    stEthPerToken   | Actual stETH/ETH  | Reported Price   | Actual Price   | Error

Normal conditions  |    1.05 |    0.99                       |1.05                  |   1.0395           | +1%
stETH trading at discount | 1.05  | 0.95                  | 1.05                 | 0.9975             | +5%
High staking rewards        | 1.10 | 1.01                   | 1.10                 | 1.111               | -1%
Withdrawals backlogged | 1.05  | 0.90                   | 1.05                 | 0.945               | +11%

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

DeFi Protocol Risks:

Loans undercollateralized during stETH discounts

Overcollateralization during stETH premiums

Arbitrage opportunities against protocol



User Harm Cases:

Users overpay for wstETH when stETH is discounted

Users receive less when selling wstETH during premiums

Liquidations triggered at incorrect prices




Systemic Risk:

Protocol insolvency if stETH depegs significantly

Cascading liquidations during market stress

Loss of user funds and protocol reputation

### Mitigation

function getPrice() external view returns (int256) {
    // 1. Get wstETH conversion rate to stETH
    uint256 stEthPerWsteth = IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken();
    
    // 2. Get current stETH/ETH market rate
    (, int256 stEthPerEth, , , ) = STETH_ETH_FEED.latestRoundData();
    
    // 3. Calculate wstETH/ETH price
    return (int256(stEthPerWsteth) * stEthPerEth) / 1e18;
