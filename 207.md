# User will exploit outflows from Lido pool to "arbitrage" ETH0

### Summary

wstETH corresponds to 1e18 shares ETH value within stETH/ETH Lido pool. Important part is shares's ETH values are subject of rebasing depends on total shares within the system and pooled ETH. Pooled ETH is either ETH staked by user - and once staked they receive corresponding amount of shares or it deposited by Lido as validator's reward - in such case no shares are added - means corresponding value of shares to ETH increases.
Described explains how price of wstETH may vary.

Protocol receive ETH value of wstETH via Lido's oracle from wstETH-stETH contracts itself
```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc AggregatorV3Interface
    function latestRoundData()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        )
    {
        // Return mock data for all fields except answer
        roundId = 1;
        answer = int256(IWstETH(WST_ETH_CONTRACT).stEthPerToken());
        startedAt = block.timestamp;
        updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        answeredInRound = 1;
    }
```
As collateralization level of ETH0 depends on wstETH it need to be explained how it could be manipulated by Lido's stakes:


The formula for calculation eth value corresponding to 1 share: ETH staked / total shares

Consider the following example to get an intuition:
stakedETH = 1 000 000, total shares 10 000 000 
Now 1 shares corresponds to 0.1 eth

If reward by Lido will be deposited in will cause rebasing:
return to example: Lido added 5000 eth of reward -> share equal to 1 005000/ 10 000 000 = 0.1005
As we can see reward increasing eth value of our share as new ETH added to pool, but no shares minted.

Now look where problem might occur:
stakedETH = 1 000 000, total shares 10 000 000 => Whale decided to withdraw 10% of the pool
now stakedETH = 900 000, total shares 9 000 000 -> it's now still corresponds to 0,1 eth
Lido adds another 5000 eth of reward -> 0.10055555555 eth per share increased, rebasing happens and oracle reporting increased price

As such price movements have temporary effect (if reward per share was increased then it will incentivise stakes to close enter and normalize it)

Meanwhile, while price of the oracle reports artificially increased prize an attacker can swap() wstETH for ETH0 for newly updated price. As the price high it will make Usual to meant more ETH0 in exchange for wstETH.

Now user can farm yeld form holding ETH0 and wait until price normalization. User will redeem back more wstETH than it was deposited.

Such "opportunity" windows will drain collateralization from protocol - > in our example user withdraw more wstETH then he deposited.

As well as described at Lido docs, validator's misbehavior could be penalized by burning it's shares. Which is as well leads to share amount decreasing, while pooled ETH untouched and increase price of wstETH [Lido](https://docs.lido.fi/staking-modules/csm/penalties)

> The first one is burning stETH shares using the [Burner](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/burner) contract. Once confiscated shares are burnt, the total amount of stETH shares decreases. Hence, shareRate increases, effectively distributing all burned stETH value between other stETH holders.


### Root Cause

Usual incapable to hold ETH0 minted corresponding wstETH value across time, considering wstETH price fluctuations

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

big outflow from Lido (we don't have to be a whale and unstake something yourself, as mempool tx will be visible)/big validator's reward about to be distributed/some validator's shares about to be burned as penalties

### Attack Path

1. User monitor whether price increased based on of the mentioned conditions
2. User swap() wstETH on USUAL
3. User farm ETH0 yeld and withdraw bigger amount of wstETH in moment price normalized 

### Impact

decreasing collateralization of ETH0 over time
